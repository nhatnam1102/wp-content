It is estimated that about 17 million Americans suffer from alcohol use disorders. Most of the people who suffer from these disorders do not want to go in for treatment which means that they continue suffering without any help and end up later to regret the decision not to seek help.    Almost 85,000 people die in America from alcohol related causes. This makes it the 3rd leading preventable cause of the death in the country. The alcohol problem also causes a huge financial decision where almost $224 billion were used to cover property damage, healthy care and loss of productivity.

48,"5 Key Symptoms of Alcoholism",5-key-symptoms-of-alcoholism,2014/08/01,"If you suspect that a friend or loved one has a problem with alcoholism but do not want to confront this person without being sure that you are right, then consider the five symptoms outlined below. While many of these <a title=""Alcohol Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects"" href=""http://substanceabuserehabs.com/alcohol-abuse/"">symptoms of alcoholism</a> can be attributed to more than one cause, those who have a number of these problems are very likely to <a title=""How to Help an Alcoholic?"" href=""http://substanceabuserehabs.com/alcohol-abuse/how-to-help-an-alcoholic/"">need help in dealing with a dependence on alcohol.</a>  <h2>Withdrawal from Others</h2>  While some people naturally prefer to be on their own, it is unusual for a person to completely avoid going out with other people. However, many individuals with an alcohol problem do just that in an attempt to hide their problem from others. If a friend or relative who usually enjoys hanging out with you suddenly comes up with numerous excuses as to why he or she cannot do so, then something could be wrong.  <h2>Inability to Work and/or Study Properly</h2>  Many people who have trouble with alcohol drink not only at night or on the weekends but also during normal work or study hours. Naturally, their work and/or scholastic performance take a hit. A person who is performing poorly at work and/or is continually receiving poor grades and may have trouble working due to excessive drinking, could be signs of a drinking problem.  <h2>Physical Symptoms</h2>  There are also physical signs that a person is becoming overly dependent on alcohol. Signs can include problems with a sore stomach and red nose and cheeks. Naturally, a person's breath can also be an indicator, as alcohol has a naturally strong smell. However, many people use breath fresheners and change their clothes regularly in an attempt to hide their problem.  <h2>Symptoms of Withdrawal Attempts</h2>  Most people know that dependence on alcohol is an unhealthy; in fact, many such individuals make one or even more attempts to kick the bad habit on their own. While this may work in some cases, especially if a person does not have a long-standing dependence on alcohol, it is usually not a good idea to attempt alcohol withdrawal without medical help, as withdrawal symptoms can be not only dangerous but even fatal. It is best to seek treatment as a residential treatment facility that offers medically supervised detox, meaning physicians will monitor your detox and administer drugs to help minimize the effects of withdrawal.    Some signs that a person may be trying to kick an alcohol habit on his or her own include anxiety, seizures, sweating, regular stomachaches and nausea. Some people also get shaky. If you see a loved one or friend experience these <strong>symptoms of alcoholism</strong>, then seek immediate medical help. Most alcohol rehabilitation centers offer detoxification and can help an individual get through these and other symptoms in a safe manner.  <h2>Alcohol in Unlikely Places</h2>  Finally, it is important to be on the lookout for alcohol in unlikely places. While there may be good reason for the average adult to have some alcohol in a cupboard, refrigerator or freezer, there is no good reason for an individual to have alcoholic beverages in a car or at work. If you find alcohol in an unlikely place, it is time to confront you friend about his or her drinking problem and encourage him or her to get help.    Alcohol on its own is not a bad thing. Many people enjoy a drink or two at a party, over the weekend or even a glass of wine every night before going to bed. However, becoming dependent on alcohol can be a matter of life and death, as excessive alcohol consumption is very bad for one's health. What is more, it will destroy a person's work life and his or her relationships with family members and friends. If you suspect that someone you know and love has a drinking problem, do not stay quiet about it. Look for the symptoms and then help your friend realize that he or she needs help in order to overcome the problem and lead a healthy, normal life."

52,"What Causes Alcoholism and Alcohol Addiction? ",what-causes-alcoholism,2014/08/01,"<h2>The Causes of Alcohol Addiction</h2>  Alcoholism is one of the major problems that are affecting many people all around the world. This is where a woman or man has a distinct physical desire to take more alcohol than they can control and they normally crave in at the worst possible times. Unfortunately, the patient does not know how or when to stop drinking. One of the most prominent questions that people who have loved ones affected by this disease is what causes alcoholism? The exact cause is still unknown but research has shown that there are a number of factors that can contribute to this such as:  <h2>Genetic Factors and Alcoholism</h2>  These appear to play a huge role and may account for about half the risk of alcoholism. The role genetics play can be quite complex but there is a likelihood that there are different genes that are involved. Studies suggests that dependence on alcohol and other substances could be associated with generic variations in about 51 various chromosomal regions. Although unproven, inherited traits may also be associated with alcoholism and some of them include brain chemical imbalance after abusing alcohol for a long time. Research has shown that alcohol has widespread effects on a person's brain and it affects nerve cells (neurons), blood flow and brain chemistry on the brain's frontal lobes.    <a title=""Alcohol Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects"" href=""http://substanceabuserehabs.com/alcohol-abuse/"">Long-term abuse of alcohol</a> also affects the brain's chemical messengers (neurotransmitters). If a person who is dependent on alcohol stops drinking, agitation and an over excited nervous system is created by chemical responses in the brain. This triggers withdrawal systems like increasing heart rate and blood pressure. This normally produces the need to take more alcohol so as to calm down.    Consuming alcoholic drinks also stimulates the release of numerous neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin and opioid peptides. These are responsible for producing euphoric feelings, a sensation of a sense of well-being and being rewarded. With time however, drinking too much alcohol depletes sources of serotonin and dopamine. Drinking persistently in the long run fails to restore a person's mood. By the time this happens, it is usually too late as the person abusing alcohol already believes that consuming alcohol will help improve/boost their spirits even when in the actual sense it does not happen.    The amygdala, the section of the brain that deals with craving emotional aspects, has been reported to be smaller in the people whose families have a history with alcoholism.    Serotin a neurotransmitter (brain chemical messenger) plays a vital role when it comes to associated and well being behaviors i.e. sleep, relaxation and eating. A person who has abnormal serotin levels is said to have high alcohol tolerance levels.    Individuals may also inherit lack of warning signs that help people stop drinking. Even when genetic factors are not present, repeated exposure to the alcoholic drinks increases a person's ability to tolerate huge amounts before they can experience behavioral impairment. <a title=""5 Key Symptoms of Alcoholism"" href=""http://substanceabuserehabs.com/alcohol-abuse/5-key-symptoms-of-alcoholism/"">Learn more about the symptoms of alcoholism here.</a>  <h2>Emotional and Social Causes of Alcoholism</h2>  There are a number of factors that can cause alcoholism affecting the emotional and social well being of an individual such as social pressure, internal temptation, anger, and frustration. Other things here include:  <h3>Emotional and Mental Stress</h3>  Most of the time, alcohol is perceived as a loyal friend when a person is going through stressful moments or their human relationships are failing. This is normally associated with freedom as well as loss of inhibition that normally offsets the boring and tedious daily routines. When a person wants to quit, the brain normally wants to restore the ""equilibrium"" state where a person has to drink more.  <h3>Social Drinking</h3>  Most of the time, the <strong>causes of alcohol addiction</strong> root from social drinking. This escalates quickly to heavy drinking where a person would rather be drinking than doing any other important thing in their life. Since there is a very thin line between heavy drinking and alcoholism, it becomes very easy to slip into the disease.    If you or a loved one is struggling with heavy drinking or alcohol abuse do not delay. Withdrawal from alcohol can be life threatening and it is best to attend a medically supervised detox and addiction treatment center."

It is for this reason that cocaine is often used as a party drug. Cocaine also decreases fatigue in its users, allowing them to stay awake for much longer than they would normally be able to. This has led some to use coke as a drug for work, harnessing its seemingly positive characteristics to concentrate on their work while simultaneously being able to stay awake for longer amounts of time.    When high amounts of cocaine are introduced to the system, many severe changes in behavior can take place. Irritability, coupled with confused and disorderly behavior, can lead some cocaine users to become violent and irrational while on the drug. Also, hallucinations may occur, leading to extreme sense of paranoia and an ""everyone is out to get me"" mentality. Cocaine users are sometimes known to become antisocial and aggressive, making them dangerous to themselves and to others. Along with its psychological effects, cocaine can affect the human body in many ways. Cocaine increases the heart rate, blood pressure, and overall body temperature of users. Breathing is sped up, and these things, coupled with nervous restlessness, can lead to heavy perspiration. Although cocaine decreases the desire to sleep and eat, the most common health problems associated with cocaine use are seizures, strokes, and heart attacks, especially in people who are susceptible or predisposed to having them.  <h2>Long-Term Effects of Abusing Cocaine</h2>  When using cocaine regularly over an extended period of time, more serious psychological changes occur within the brain. Cocaine's stimulating qualities combined with its propensity to induce paranoia can lead to further violent act and mood swings. Insomnia is normal among cocaine addicts, and combined with cocaine's tendency to suppress a user's appetite can lead to unhealthy weight loss. As with any insufflated substance, damage to the inside of the nose cartilage can take place, and will eventually tear a hole in the septum with repeated use.    Although cocaine may seem like an innocent party drug, this is not the case. Nobody likes to party with a paranoid drug user who may at any time become delusional and violent. Not only that, but partying too much while on cocaine can lead to death from heart attack, stroke, or overheating of the body. This, combined with cocaine's addictive properties, makes it a very dangerous drug to abuse.  <h2>Statistic of Cocaine Abuse</h2>  The highest rate of cocaine use happens with young adults, age 18-25, where 90% of people who have used cocaine started with alcohol or marijuana before trying cocaine, and 25% of American adults age 26-34 have tried cocaine at least once during their lifetime. In the United States, the 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health reports that 46.7 million Americans aged 12 and older reported having used cocaine.    Lately, cocaine abuse and also dependency became the most frequent causes of the sufferers visiting emergency rooms. Interesting to note is the cocaine abuse found according to racial lines. The most common group of cocaine abusers is American Indians and/or Alaskan natives. Their rate of cocaine use is about 2 %. Other cocaine use rates include 1.6 percent for African Americans, 0.8 % for Caucasians, 0.8 % for Hispanics, 0.6 % for Pacific Islanders and/or Native Hawaiians and 0.2 percent for %. As a result, some agency resources are being concentrated in areas where certain races reside and cocaine use is higher.

63,"Crack Cocaine Abuse",crack-cocaine-abuse,2014/08/01,"<h1>Crack Cocaine Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects</h1>  <a title=""Cocaine Abuse"" href=""http://substanceabuserehabs.com/cocaine-abuse/"">Cocaine</a> has a surprisingly honorable history. Its most basic ingredient, the coca leaf, can be traced back to as far as 5000-3000 BC where it was used, in what we now know as Latin America, to help alleviate hunger and cope with working at a high altitude. It was also used for embalming, healing wounds, and as an anesthetic. Lastly, when trade started to increase between Europe and Latin America in the 1500's, people were able to acquire land by paying in coca leaves.    It wasn't until the 1600's when the coca leaf was openly used as a stimulant. By the late 1800's, cocaine wine became widely popular and athletes started using the coca leaf to increase their physical performance. Despite its obvious increasing demand for recreational use, it was also during this time that medical science saw its value. Doctors started using cocaine in order to treat morphine addictions of American civil war soldiers. It also leads to the development of anesthetics like Lidocaine and Novocain.    Towards the end of 1800's, however, mass production of refined cocaine started increasing. When the 1900's started, people started carrying cocaine in boxes to snort. This prompted the government to withdraw the ingredient from food and drugs due to its addictive nature.    Over the years, the US became one of the biggest consumers of cocaine, prompting Latin American dealers to produce more to the point of creating an over-saturated market. Sales started to dip and producers had to come up with a plan to increase their income. <em>Their solution was to mix powdered cocaine with either ammonia or sodium bicarbonate to make the drug more powerful. Thus, <strong>crack cocaine</strong> was born.</em>    The 80's and the 90's are considered to be the golden years of crack cocaine. Partygoers were its main market since it was fairly easy to carry; it was even easier to mass-produce. It found its way to the streets of New York and then to London. The rest of the world soon followed.    Today, despite giving way to more accessible drugs like ecstasy (more popularly known as E), crack cocaine remains to be one of the top drugs being used by abusers.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Crack Cocaine Abuse</h2>  If you suspect a loved one to be using crack cocaine, one of the simplest ways to check is to look at their lips. Crack pipes are usually short so when crack is burned along with other substances, it can create severe blistering on the lips. An abuser's sleeping pattern can also become erratic. Try to make a log of the person's sleeping habits. You can also look out for dilated pupils and excited chatter.    Other signs and symptoms may involve hallucinations, unreasonable mood swings, anxiety, unexplained boost of confidence, fast breathing, a spike in heart rate, lack of hygiene, and lack of appetite.  <h2>Short and Long Term Effects of Abusing Crack Cocaine</h2>  Some previously mentioned symptoms, like blistered lips and hallucinations, could also be the short-term effect of crack use. It only takes one use for some people to get completely addicted to it. When that happens, they experience a strong and immediate craving for crack and may become violent towards people who deny them the drug or the money to get the drug. This also usually leads to paranoia as it creates the feeling that the whole world is against them.    Sadly, the long term effects of crack cocaine are a lot more damaging to the user's health. First, it destroys a person's respiratory system. Snorting it immediately damages your nose and may result to nasal perforation. It then travels downwards where in can inflame your lungs and cause permanent lung damage.    Second, crack cocaine restricts the arteries and blood vessels in three major areas: the heart, the brain, and the stomach. Restriction in the heart can cause heart attacks even in very young patients, restriction in the brain causes strokes and seizures, and finally, restriction in the stomach can cause severe perforation and ulcers.    Third, it can affect your urinary system by severely damaging your kidneys. Rhabdomyolysis in crack abusers is not uncommon. It is a process that involves a lot of vomiting, severe muscle pain, and extreme confusion. Ultimately, this all leads to a very painful kidney failure.    Lastly, the abuser experiences a decline in sexual ability and function. It will eventually render you incapable of reaching an orgasm usually leading to an impaired ejaculation (for both men and women).  <h2>Statistics of Crack Cocaine</h2>  Here are some interesting numbers on crack cocaine:  <ul>  	<li>During this time of writing, about 25 million people in the US alone have used it at least once in their lifetime.</li>  	<li>By 2006, more than 8 million minors above 12 years old have tried using crack.</li>  	<li>At least 23 million Americans suffer from crack abuse but only about 2 million seek out the help they need.</li>  	<li>18-25 year olds are more likely to abuse the drug.</li>  	<li>By 2011, approximately 149,000 hectares were used for coca plantations with Colombia leading the way at 61,200 hectares.</li>  	<li>Cocaine addiction adds approximately $11 billion to healthcare costs each year and the number keeps rising.</li>  	<li>More than half of crack users dabble in other drugs.</li>  	<li>Since 2012, there are about 1,800 people a day who are using crack for the very first time.</li>  	<li>Majority of crack users are Caucasian males.</li>  	<li>The supply of cocaine has been decreasing since 2007 due to the increase in demand and the decrease in production in Colombia.</li>  </ul>  For more information on how to help yourself or a loved one who is dealing with crack cocaine addiction, <a title=""How to Help a Loved One"" href=""http://substanceabuserehabs.com/how-to/how-to-help-a-loved-one/"">click here</a>."
65,"5 Key Signs and Symptoms of Cocaine Use",5-key-signs-and-symptoms-of-cocaine-use,2014/08/01,"Cocaine is an highly addictive substance and its use is deadly and widespread. The fine white powder is a powerful stimulant that produces an energetic high. Some of the signs you need to be on the lookout for to know if someone you love or know is using it include:  <h2>1. Physical Signs of Cocaine Use</h2>  A person who is using cocaine may experience a racing heart rate, intense stimulation and dilated pupils. The user may also exhibit signs of endless and fast paced chattering in addition to signs of elevation. Alternatively, the user may appear to be restless, full of anxiety and irritable. Body temperatures and blood pressure also rise when a person is high. Because the high does not last for a long time, the user may retract to a secluded location as it wears off they may become depressed, fatigued and zapped of mental clarity and energy. The more a person becomes hooked to cocaine the more they may increase the frequency of doses. This normally results in less euphoria and more anxiety. Paranoia can also set in and in severe cases; it can result into a highly paranoid state where a person can act irrationally because of her or his loss with reality. Other signs include things such as blood shot eyes, constant runny and sniffling nose as well as frequent nosebleeds.  <h2>2. Evidence left lying around</h2>  Among the five key signs and symptoms of cocaine use and probably the most obvious one is traceable evidence that is left behind by the users. This includes things such as streaks of white powder that are normally left on CD cases, glass or mirrors. Some users may use cut straws, rolled up dollar bills or miniscule spoons that are common paraphernalia that are used to snort the drug. Cocaine is normally transported in small bags that feature zipper closures.  <h2>3. Changes in behavior</h2>  Individuals who are using cocaine also start showing changes in behavior. This is because it can skew eating and sleeping habits where a person's appetite is killed and they are not able to sleep well. This may lead to missing appointments, skipping classes in school and a negative/angry attitude towards family and friends. The person abusing the drug may end up pushing aside the activities they once loved doing and spending more time alone. In some cases, they may even drop the good friends they once had and start hanging out with individuals who are of questionable character. The abuser may also suffer from extreme mood swings and there are times when they may even become violent towards people around them for no apparent reason.  <h2>4. Personality change</h2>  Another point among the five key signs and symptoms of cocaine use include a change in the personality of the user. This usually happens all of a sudden where people close to the abuser realize that there is something unusual going on. Some of the things that you may notice include a person constantly lying to cover up their bad habits. A person may also become over sensitive even with the slightest provocation because they think that you are on your way to uncovering their dangerous habit. A person who was once full of life and had a positive outlook could suddenly show that they lack motivation to do anything. This is where you can find a person losing their job or being kicked out from school.  <h2>5. Loss of control</h2>  Users of cocaine normally experience bursts of loss of control where the user ends up using more than they can actually control. This is where they no longer control the time periods they initially set to use the drug sinking deeper and deeper into the problem. When a person saying that they are using for the last time, they end up doing it over and over again as the drug takes control of their body as the body craves more of the drug.. Some users may desire to stop but they physically can't due to the cravings and withdrawal symptoms. This is regardless of all the steps they take to try and shun the habit and move on with their life.    Should you notice any of the above signs and symptoms, make sure you <a title=""How to Help a Loved One"" href=""http://substanceabuserehabs.com/how-to/how-to-help-a-loved-one/"" target=""_blank"">get help</a> for the user, as this is the only way they can control their lives and avoid and/or stop <a title=""Cocaine Abuse"" href=""http://substanceabuserehabs.com/cocaine-abuse/"" target=""_blank"">cocaine abuse</a>."
68,"Crystal Meth Addiction",crystal-meth-addiction,2014/08/01,"Crystal meth is a shortened term for crystal methamphetamine. It is yet another form of drug called methamphetamine, and it has surpassed cocaine as main drug of choice for younger people. It is a very dangerous drug which leaves very real and life ending consequences on long-term users.  <h2>Overview of Crystal Meth</h2>  It is a white crystal drug which people can be taken by snorting, injecting or smoking. Some people even take it orally, even though all of them start to develop a very strong desire for continuation of usage because of false sense of confidence and happiness, as well as energy and hyper activeness. Crystal meth's effects usually last from 6 to 8 hours, but it can last for up to 24 hours. Meth addiction has become a very negative subject in US and throughout the globe in past couple of years, so it is highly recommended for everyone's relative or a friend to seek treatment as soon as possible for crystal meth addicts. First experience with this drug may bring some pleasure, but methamphetamine begins to destroy user's life from the beginning, so it is highly important for anyone to seek treatment once the user gets addicted or starts using.    Methamphetamine is certainly not a very new drug, even though it has only become powerful and popular in last couple of years since techniques for its manufacturing have highly evolved into something new. First amphetamine was made back in 1888 in Germany, and first methamphetamine has been developed in 1919 in Japan. Methamphetamine has been in a very wide usage during World War II which was used for both sides to keep their troops awake. Very high doses were being given to Kamikaze pilots who went on suicide missions. Once the war ended, methamphetamine abuse with injection has reached its epidemic proportions when they were largely supplied for Japanese public.    After 1960s, its pattern completely changed with increasing availability of injectable meth, which has worsened the abuse completely. During 1990s, Mexican organizations for drug trafficking have set up huge laboratories located in California, which were able to generate 55 pounds of substance in just one week. Manufacturing of crystal methamphetamine has started in late 2000s, and now it has become one of the most used drug substances available on illegal market.  <h2><a title=""5 Key Signs and Symptoms of Crystal Meth Use"" href=""http://substanceabuserehabs.com/crystal-meth-overview-signs-and-symptoms-and-effects/5-key-signs-and-symptoms-of-crystal-meth-use/"">Signs and Symptoms of Crystal Meth Addiction</a></h2>  <a title=""5 Key Signs and Symptoms of Crystal Meth Use"" href=""http://substanceabuserehabs.com/crystal-meth-overview-signs-and-symptoms-and-effects/5-key-signs-and-symptoms-of-crystal-meth-use/"">Crystal meth has various symptoms</a> that are mostly related to the drug's impact on user's body. It has a very stimulant nature, so therefore it brings a lot of signs and symptoms by using crystal methamphetamine. One single sign should not determine complete addiction on someone, but if there are several signs showing over a small period of time, then it could certainly mean that addiction has developed.    Most often signs of <strong>crystal meth addiction</strong> can be seen in sudden weight loss, dilated pupils, extreme loss of appetite, very repetitious behavior, eye twitching and hyperactivity. People that are suffering from methamphetamine addiction can also stay awake for days, which is often followed by extreme crash, which means that they will sleep for a very long period of time. Addicts can also go into manic phases, in which they can have very obsessive and compulsive needs for cleaning.    People that have been addicted for a longer period of time will show bigger signs of very extreme case of weight loss, sores on their face and mouth, seizures and rotted teeth.  <h2>Effects of Abusing Crystal Meth</h2>  Crystal meth effects can mostly be categorized as mental or physical effects. Crystal methamphetamine can have various effects on brain function, and cause damage to user's brain cells. This exact damage can lead to seizures and short termed memory loss.    Usage of crystal meth can also have pretty extreme effect on someone's skin, by causing skin abscesses that often become infected for its weakened immune system. It also leads to longer amount of sicknesses for crystal meth abusers. It can also have other various negative effects, such as:  <ul>  	<li>Blindness</li>  	<li>Kidney failure</li>  	<li>Respiratory failure</li>  	<li>Internal bleeding</li>  	<li>Malnutrition and</li>  	<li>Chest pain.</li>  </ul>  Effects can also be rather psychological and include:  <ul>  	<li>States of paranoia and psychosis</li>  	<li>Mood instability</li>  	<li>Suicidal thoughts</li>  	<li>Delusion</li>  	<li>Schizophrenia</li>  </ul>  <h2>Crystal Meth Statistics</h2>  Most important statistic about crystal meth is in the statistic that shows us that there are more than 24.8 million abusers of methamphetamine in the world.

71,"5 Key Signs and Symptoms of Crystal Meth Use",5-key-signs-and-symptoms-of-crystal-meth-use,2014/08/01,"<a title=""Crystal Meth Addiction"" href=""http://substanceabuserehabs.com/crystal-meth-addiction/"">Crystal Meth</a> also known as methamphetamine can be described as a highly addictive stimulant that can be taken by mouth, inhaled, injected or smoked. This is a manufactured drug whose popularity has rapidly risen over the years and can be very addictive. It can have extensive damaging effects to a person's body including memory loss, eating away the brain and loss of other motor skills. The five key signs and symptoms of crystal meth use that you should be on the lookout for if you suspect a person is abusing the drug include:  <h2>1. Weight loss</h2>  It is not uncommon to see someone who is addicted to meth losing a lot of weight within a short period of time. This is simply because this is one of the drugs that are considered a stimulant. Using the drug normally leads to rapid weight loss. It may also lead to increased levels of energy, which also enhances the weight loss process. When a person is using meth, their appetite is also suppressed and it also promotes the inability to sleep or sit still thus the body ends up using more energy that may cause a person to lose some weight. This dramatic weight loss can pose some serious health problems to the person.  <h2>2. Meth mouth</h2>  This is one of the most common things to look out for when dealing with five key signs and symptoms of crystal meth use. When a person uses meth for a long time, their teeth begin rotting. This happens especially when they are smoking or snorting the drug. This is mainly caused by the chemicals in the drug that are normally left to reside in the mouth leading to damaged gums and teeth. Meth mouth normally causes the teeth to completely rot away and it may also result in periodontal disease that cannot be reversed. In addition to this the addict usually has dry and cracked lips.  <h2>3. Social problems</h2>  Another warning sign you should be on the lookout for to catch a meth addict is developing social problems. As the addiction starts to get hold of a person, they normally withdraw, although it is not an immediate thing as it happens slowly. An addict may start by becoming distant before they draw away into their own cocoon. Because the drug changes how a person's brain works, you may also discover that young people become sexually promiscuous which increases the risk of contracting STDs and getting unwanted pregnancies.  <h2>4. Financial problems</h2>  Meth addition can make a person experience some financially difficult times as they seek money to buy the drug. The problems are so common and it can reach a time where addicts will do anything to get the money to satisfy their addiction. This is because money soon runs out especially if a person does not have a source of income or has been laid off/fired as a result of their drug use. Reaching a dealer easily also gives them the motivation to spend on the drug and feel like it is not any trouble. This is where you find individuals stealing or doing other illegal things trying to access the drug.  <h2>5. Energy tip</h2>  Also on the list of five key signs and symptoms of crystal meth use is that persons addicted to the drug usually tend to have more energy especially in the beginning. This can appear as ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). A person with such bouts of energy may refuse to stay still for a long time. For a person who is naturally calm and quiet, this can be one of the easiest sighs to know that a person is addicted to meth but it may be quite hard for a person who is generally energetic as you may not notice the change.

Drug usage can lead to abuse, which will further lead to changes in the brain. These changes can impair a drug user's and/or addict's capacity to recognize the <a title=""Drug names from a-z"" href=""http://substanceabuserehabs.com/drugs-a-z/"">negative effects of the substance</a> they are using. It can also salvage relationships, which are often affected when an individual starts taking drugs. Early detection is crucial because it can help to prevent permanent brain damage.    It is necessary to identify any significant change in your loved one's life if you are trying to <a title=""Drug names a-z"" href=""http://substanceabuserehabs.com/drugs-a-z/"">detect substance abuse</a>. Here are five key signs and symptoms of substance abuse that you should watch out for:  <h2>1. Sudden Mood and Behavior Changes</h2>  Watch your partner or child carefully if you suspect drug use to identify any sudden changes in their mood and behavior. You should be concerned if they have suddenly changed from an extreme high to an extreme low. If they are exceedingly energetic and appear more restless than usual, they may be using a particular drug.    Drug users also tend to speak more often and most of them find it difficult to sleep because they are on a high. However, some addicts may appear abnormally calm, depressed, or indifferent while others may sleep soundly for extended periods.    Their moods may also change drastically. The person may be irritable or angry one minute and appear cheerful or happy the next. Look for any extremes in your loved ones. There are situations when the extreme changes are not related to drug use but they can indicate another serious physical or mental health issue.  <h2>2. Unforeseen Changes in Grooming Habits and Dressing</h2>  This is another indication that your loved one may be using drugs. If they are no longer concerned about grooming and personal hygiene, there could be a problem.    A person who suddenly prefers to cover every part of their body when they used to wear revealing clothes may be trying to hide physical signs of drug use. Needle track marks are usually visible on addicts who take drugs intravenously. They may also have some scarring that they are want to cover up with their clothes.    An addict tends to focus on the highs they get from the drug and how they will get their next dose. This may explain why most of them will neglect themselves. The drugs have already altered their brain and they are no longer interested in maintaining proper hygiene. If your loved one is suddenly messy, it may indicate drug use.  <h2>3. Suspicious Equipment</h2>  An addict may also leave some suspicious equipment around the house. Look for drug contraptions, syringes, pipes, rolling papers, eye drops, makeshift smoking gadgets, and medicine bottles. These things should raise suspicion if the individual does not suffer from any known medical condition.  <h2>4. Health and Physical Complications</h2>  There are certain physical and health complications that may suggest that an individual is taking drugs. These complications may be caused by the drug use. If your loved one is snorting drugs, they may have frequent nosebleeds, running nose or sinus infections. Sudden weight gain or loss can also indicate drug use. Dental problems are another sign that your loved one may be abusing drugs. Crystal Meth is one of the drugs that affect the teeth.    Addicts who prefer to smoke their drugs may suffer from bronchitis and excessive coughs. Some of them may start to cough blood because of the damage caused by the drug in respiratory system.  <h2>5. Withdrawal</h2>  A loved one who suddenly withdraws from their friends and family may be utilizing drugs. They may also withdraw from activities that they used to enjoy. If you notice that a loved one seems withdrawn, it is advisable to investigate the matter further to determine if they are using drugs.    When you recognize drug use and/or <a title=""How to Help a Loved One"" href=""http://substanceabuserehabs.com/how-to/how-to-help-a-loved-one/"">abuse in a loved one</a>, it is important to encourage them to seek treatment as soon as possible. <a title=""Treatment Modalities"" href=""http://substanceabuserehabs.com/treatment-modalities/"">Addiction treatment</a> can help to reverse some of the changes caused by the drug.

81,"Adderall Addiction - Signs, Symptoms and Effects",adderall-addiction-signs-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/01,"Adderall is a mixture of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine used to treat and narcolepsy and the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The drug is a central nervous system stimulant and is prescribed by a physician to persons suffering from ADHD. Patients are usually put on a low dose, which can be gradually increased if necessary.    Adderall abuse on the other hand occurs when people take the drug for nonmedical reasons. The most popular of which is to stay up longer and increase concentration; in fact, abuse is highest among college and university students. But some students also take Adderall for recreational purposes. For one it is easily available and because it is available through the medical field, taking it does not exactly carry the same stigma as for example cocaine or heroin, as it's viewed as ""OK"" because it's prescribed by a physician, although the side effects are largely similar.    Adderall is classified a Schedule II Controlled Substance, meaning that anyone found with the pills without a doctor's prescription is liable to the same criminal charges as anyone caught with opiates, methylphenidate, methamphetamine and other amphetamines. Schedule II Controlled Substances are also extremely addictive and life threatening in the case of overdose. Penalties vary from state to state but in general, sellers face stiffer penalties than buyers.    Signs and symptoms of Adderall abuse include:  <ul>  	<li>Uncontrollable shaking of a part of the body</li>  	<li>Difficulty staying asleep</li>  	<li>Changes in sex drive</li>  	<li>Loss of appetite</li>  	<li>Stomach pain</li>  	<li>Weight loss</li>  	<li>Nervousness</li>  	<li>Restlessness</li>  	<li>Constipation</li>  	<li>Headache</li>  	<li>Dry mouth</li>  	<li>Diarrhea</li>  	<li>Nausea</li>  </ul>  Some symptoms of a severe include:  <ul>  	<li>Pounding or fast heartbeat</li>  	<li>Excessive tiredness</li>  	<li>Weakness in the arms or legs</li>  	<li>Numbness of arms or legs</li>  	<li>Blistering or peeling skin</li>  	<li>Slow or difficult speech</li>  	<li>Shortness of breath</li>  	<li>Verbal or motor tics</li>  	<li>Aggressive behavior</li>  	<li>Changes in vision</li>  	<li>Hallucinations</li>  	<li>Blurred vision</li>  	<li>Chest pain</li>  	<li>Hoarseness</li>  	<li>Swelling</li>  	<li>Paranoia</li>  	<li>Seizures</li>  	<li>Dizziness</li>  	<li>Mania</li>  	<li>Itching</li>  	<li>Hives</li>  	<li>Rash</li>  </ul>  If you suspect an overdose, call your local emergency services immediately. The Common overdose symptoms include:  <ul>  	<li>Uncontrollable shakes</li>  	<li>Quickened breathing</li>  	<li>Feelings of panic</li>  	<li>Irregular heartbeat</li>  	<li>Hallucinations</li>  	<li>Restlessness</li>  	<li>Confusion</li>  	<li>Coma</li>  	<li>Dizziness</li>  </ul>  <h2>Effects of Abusing Adderall</h2>  The facts on Adderall abuse show that abusing Adderall can result in more dangerous side effects. Problems such as addiction, dependency and tolerance are common. The possibility of an overdose is very high and this can be fatal. Even if one survives an overdose, they risk permanent brain damage because of the chemical properties of the drug. Because it is a stimulant, Adderall may increase a smoker's craving for cigarettes thereby exposing such an individual to more smoking-related ailments.    In addition to the above effects, studies have shown that persons using Adderall as a recreational drug are more likely to mix it with alcohol. This is because Adderall counteracts some of the signs of excessive consumption of alcohol. This is extremely dangerous because a person can succumb to alcohol poisoning with no prior warning. Mixing alcohol and Adderall also exposes the victim to dehydration further aggravating the psychological problems associated with Adderall use and withdrawal.    Remember that if you are found in possession or dealing with the Adderall without a doctor's prescription, you risk severe legal ramifications.  <h2>Statistics of Adderall Addiction</h2>  According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, Adderall abuse is highest among college students and young adults. Statistics estimate that 20% to 30% of college and university students abuse Adderall on a regular basis.    Adderall is the latest addition to the rogue's gallery of prescription drugs that have found their way to the black market. In the recent past, abuse of Adderall and related drugs has increased by almost 200%.    The same study also found out that 15% of college students have taken Adderall, Ritalin or a related stimulant in the recent past. Out of the group, only 2% have a prescription, the rest get the drug from their peers on campus.  Studies by the US Department of Health and Human Services also indicate that 90% of college students who abuse Adderall drink heavily. This has been attributed to the fact that Adderall counterbalances the signs of heavy alcohol consumption. But while doing this, such persons binge drink and this exposes them to even worse effects.  <h2>Adderall Abuse Treatment</h2>  If you or <a title=""How to Help a Loved One"" href=""http://substanceabuserehabs.com/how-to/how-to-help-a-loved-one/"">your loved one needs treatment</a> for <strong>Adderall addiction</strong>, a rehab center can help.

83,"Ambien Addiction Treatment - Signs and Symptoms and Effects",ambien-addiction-treatment-signs-and-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/01,"<h2>Ambien Addiction Treatment</h2>  Ambien Addiction Treatment can either be inpatient or outpatient depending on the individual's needs. The person addicted to Ambien may require therapy to identify the cause of their insomnia and why the patient thinks they need the drug. Care is offered by various medical professionals including social workers, therapists, nurses, physicians, therapists, counselors, and psychiatrists. Sleep aids are useful if they are used for a specific period but the most effective way to fight your sleeping problems is to identify their underlying cause.  <h2>Ambien Overview</h2>  Ambien, also referred to as Zolpidem, is a prescription drug recommended for insomnia patients. It is a sedative-hypnotic that helps to initiate and maintain normal sleep. This medication works by slowing down brain activity, making it easy for you to sleep. It is available in 5 mg capsules, 10 mg tablets, and 6.25 mg controlled release tablets. Some of its street names include: No-Go Pills, A-minus, and Zombie Pills.    Ambien addiction occurs when patients fail to follow the doctor's instructors when taking this medication. Addiction is possible when an individual takes it for more than two weeks. Some patients take it to get a high. It can cause a feeling of euphoria especially when it is combined with alcohol. An Ambien addict may cook, snort, or crush Ambien to make it easy to take. Taking a higher dose than recommended can give a rush type of effect. This drug is supposed to be ingested slowly over a few hours but addicts can inject it into the body to get a sudden high. An Ambien addict may fight the urge to sleep, which the drug creates. This often leads to hallucinations, visual effects or an intense high.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Ambien Addiction</h2>  Ambien dependence can either be physical or psychological. If your body no longer functions properly when you fail to take this medication, you are physically dependent. You may find it difficult to fall asleep if you do not take the pills. Psychological dependence is evident when an individual thinks that they require this prescription drug for their body to function normally. In such cases, the individual may not actually need the drug. This kind of dependence can lead to panic and anxiety symptoms when Ambien is not available. You can suffer from insomnia because of the stress caused by your psychological addiction to the drug.    Tolerance is also possible if you have been taking Ambien for longer than the recommended period. Once you become tolerant, your body will require higher doses to get the desired effect.  <h2>Effects of Abusing Ambien</h2>  Ambien abuse can cause several short-term side effects including:  <ul>  	<li>Weakness</li>  	<li>Unsteady gait</li>  	<li>Shaking</li>  	<li>Slowed heartbeat</li>  	<li>Slowed breathing</li>  	<li>Intense drowsiness</li>  </ul>  This prescription medication is only designed for short-term use. If you take it over an extended period, you may suffer from various long-term effects including:  <ul>  	<li>Dependence</li>  	<li>Delusion</li>  	<li>Impaired reasoning and judgment</li>  	<li>Low libido</li>  </ul>  One of the main concerns about Ambien abuse is that you may not recall the number of times that you have taken the drug, making you more likely to overdose. Ambien is not recommended for pregnant women even for short-term use. This is because the drug has not been tested for this particular population and there is no way to determine its effects on the pregnant woman and the baby.  <h2>Ambien Withdrawal</h2>  An Ambien addict can find it difficult to stop taking this prescription sedative if they believe they need it to sleep. They may also suffer from some intense withdrawal symptoms when they try to quit. Some of the common Ambien withdrawal symptoms that you may suffer from include:  <ul>  	<li>Aggressive behavior</li>  	<li>Confusion</li>  	<li>Suicidal thoughts</li>  	<li>Anxiety</li>  	<li>Insomnia</li>  </ul>  The good news is that addicts can get addiction treatment to make it easy for them to stop using the drug. The <strong>Ambien addiction treatment</strong> includes detox and relapse prevention. Holistic drug treatment is offered to the patients.  <h2>Ambien Statistics</h2>  According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health carried out in 2008, about 621,000 American over 12 years old abused prescription sedatives. Ambien is one of the drugs in this category. This is about 0.2% of the country's adult population. Most Ambien addicts tend to be young adults and teens."
85,"Amobarbital Signs and Symptoms and Effects",amobarbital-signs-and-symptoms,2014/08/01,"Amobarbital, also known by the brand name Amytal Sodium or Amytal, is part of the barbiturate drug family. It is mostly prescribed for patients who are suffering from anxiety, insomnia and it is also used for preanesthetic sedation. The drug works by depressing the sensory cortex in the brain that reduces motor activity and also changes the function of the cerebellar. This results in hypnosis, sedation and drowsiness.    Amobarbital is not meant for long-term use as it has a high potential of dependency and abuse. It is considered an immediate acting drug as its sedating effects take over almost immediately and lasts for about 6-to-8 hours. However, it takes a longer period of time for the drug to leave the body. It is a white crystalline powder that has a slighter bitter taste and is odorless. It was first synthesized in 1923 in Germany. Its dependence can be life threatening and it should not be taken by patients who have a history of acute and chronic pain, severe liver impairment, hypersensitivity, porphyria and respiratory disease.  <h2>Amobarbital Signs and Symptoms</h2>  Symptoms of Amobarbital overdose normally occur after a person has taken more than they are supposed to or even more frequent doses of the medication other than what has been prescribed. They also happen when a person has taken it with a combination of another type of depressant such as alcohol and these include:  <ul>  	<li>Inability to know how much of the drug you have taken</li>  	<li>Heart defects</li>  	<li>Neural tube defects</li>  	<li>Irritability</li>  	<li>Somatic complaints</li>  	<li>Unsteady gait</li>  	<li>Muscle twitching</li>  	<li>Progressive insomnia</li>  	<li>Tremor of fingers and hands</li>  </ul>  <h2>Effects of Abusing Amobarbital</h2>  Addiction to Amobarbital increases your chances of experiencing a number of effects. At first, you may feel an extreme sense of well being and calm. However this comes with numerous negative effects on various organs in the body and examples of what a patient may suffer from include:  <ul>  	<li>Nervous system - Somnolence: this is where a person is in a constant state of drowsiness and is ready to fall asleep.</li>  	<li>Confusion, Agitation, Ataxia, Hyperkinesias, Depression, CNS, nervousness, nightmares, hallucinations, psychiatric disturbance, anxiety, insomnia, abnormality in thinking and dizziness.</li>  	<li>Cardiovascular system-hypotension, bradcardia, syncope.Hepatic- liver damage. Local-necrosis, tissue damage.</li>  	<li>Respiratory system- - apnea, hypoventilation, postoperative atelectasis. Digestive system- constipation, vomiting, nausea.</li>  	<li>Heart- low blood pressure, slow heart rate and fainting. Blood- various blood disorders.</li>  	<li>Other reported effects include: Fatigue. Sedation. Slurred speech. Headaches. Skin rashes. Coma.</li>  </ul>  <h2>Amobarbital Statistics</h2>  Reports show that there are many people who end up suffering from abusing Amobarbital because they simply do not stick to its intended use. In medical settings, a doctor or other qualified professional in the healthcare industry normally administers it through injection. It should never be administered by the user or even used in other forms unless under strict supervision of a physician or medical professional. It is a sad fact that despite the use of the drug decreasing in the past years, its illegal use continues growing over the decades. This is perhaps because of the drug's ability to counteract symptoms of some stimulating drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine. This is because they are known as downers since they can help to bring down or moderate the alertness and excitement caused by some of the stimulating drugs. United States Federal law prohibits transfer or sale of Amobarbital to another person other than the one who has the prescribed medicine.    Remember to keep the drug away from children and store it in an airtight container at controlled room temperature. To avoid suffering from the negative side effects that could end up ruining your life, it is best to consult a doctor before you start using Amobarbital. Make sure to follow all the instructions on the pack so that you do not overdose.    If you know someone who suffers from abuse or you are going through it, it is best to seek help as soon as possible so that you can stop suffering and take control of your life."

92,"Antabuse Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",antabuse-overview-signs-and-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/01,"Antabuse, also known as disulfiram, was the first approved medicine for the treatment of alcohol dependence and abuse. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating alcohol dependency. Antabuse is widely prescribed by doctors to help patients who want to quit drinking. The drug reacts by creating negative reaction when the person drinks while taking Antabuse.    When alcohol is consumed by a person, the substance is metabolized by the body of the person into another substance called acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde is a very toxic substance and can cause a number of severe hangover symptoms in heavy drinkers. Antabuse works by interfering with this metabolic process and stops the process by inhibiting the production of acetaldehyde. It also prevents the oxidation of acetaldehyde.    However, since alcoholism is a major concern for most people, a lot of individuals take this medication without consulting their physician. This can lead to greater dependency on the drug, leading to more havoc health consequences.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Antabuse Abuse</h2>  When someone drinks, the high concentration of acetaldehyde occurs and taking Antabuse can cause reactions that can range from mild to severe. Depending upon the quantity of the drug taken, and amount of alcohol consumed, the person may have to face a number of signs and symptoms.

96,"Avinza Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",avinza-overview-signs-and-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/01,"Avinza is a powerful painkiller containing morphine sulfate pellets. It is prescribed to relieve moderate to severe chronic pain. In some cases, the drug is administered to women to relieve labor pains or to a person who has had a heart attack.    Avinza is classified as a Schedule II Controlled Substance, which implies that it is a legal drug with medicinal value but whose abuse and addiction potential is very high. According to the United States National Library of Medicine, Avinza is among the most popular drugs to individuals with addictions.    Because of the morphine component in Avinza, the potential to abuse the drug is rather high. If the drug is crushed, chewed, dissolved, injected or snorted, it can lead to a fatal overdose. Persons with mental disorders, a history of alcohol or drug abuse or a family history of substance abuse are more prone to Avinza abuse.    Even persons who are on a legal prescription can easily increase the dosage knowingly or unknowingly leading to the development of physical dependence on the drug. Due to its potency, doctors only administer Avinza for a short duration of time.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Avinza Abuse</h2>  The signs and symptoms of abusing Avinza become more evident if a person suddenly stops taking the drug. The result is uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms including:  <ul>  	<li>Increased blood pressure and heart rate</li>  	<li>Abdominal cramps</li>  	<li>Dilated pupils</li>  	<li>Watery eyes</li>  	<li>Restlessness</li>  	<li>Anorexia</li>  	<li>Nausea</li>  	<li>Chills</li>  	<li>Diarrhea</li>  	<li>Joint pains</li>  </ul>  When a person starts to experience the withdrawal symptoms above, he or she should seek help. Once addiction to Avinza starts, the symptoms become harder to endure and the person needs to be admitted into a treatment program to get rid of the problem.  <h2>Effects of Abusing Avinza</h2>  There are several inherent dangers of abusing Avinza. The physical consequences of abusing the drug can be very dangerous. Consuming high amounts of the drug can lead to breathing difficulties, extreme drowsiness, a coma or even death. The danger with Avinza abuse is increased even more by the fact that the risk of overdose is very high owing to the tiny-extended release beads in the Avinza capsules. An Avinza overdose is highly fatal.    Secondly, the emotional, financial and social consequences of abusing Avinza can be very devastating. Careers and relationships can be destroyed and several years of hard work ruined in a short period of time.    Another potential consequence is in the talc content of Avinza. This inactive ingredient is not harmful if taken orally but can lead to serious problems if injected. This can range from lung problems, damage of tissues around the injection site to permanent destruction of heart valves and this can cause death.    Prolonged use or abuse of the drug can lead to development of dependence and increased tolerance for the drug. Withdrawal can therefore be a very painful process. As a matter of fact, withdrawal symptoms are felt within a few hours of discontinuing using the drug and they can last for quite a long time. It is important to seek professional help immediately to avert further risk.  <h2>Avinza Addiction Treatment</h2>  Due to the dangerous withdrawal symptoms, patients are advised to seek professional help in order to recover. For persons who have abused the drug for extended periods of time, a residential treatment facility is the best place to go. A residential treatment facility has personnel, structures and programs to help such patients overcome the addiction. Various treatment methods are employed. The basic treatment methods used include:  <ul>  	<li>Detoxification</li>  	<li>Behavioral treatments</li>  	<li>Medically assisted therapy</li>  	<li>Aftercare and continuing support</li>  </ul>  A patient is put through one or a combination of these treatment regimens depending on his or her condition based on initial assessment of the extent and impact of Avinza abuse.    An Avinza rehabilitation facility focuses to eliminate the drug from the patient's body system while at the same time preventing the occurrence of withdrawal symptoms during the recovery process.  <h2>Avinza Statistics</h2>  The abuse of prescription drugs is becoming a big problem in the USA. A report by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) in 2009 showed that 16 million American citizens aged 12 years and above used prescription pain relievers, sedatives, stimulants or tranquilizers for non-medical purposes in 2008. Painkillers were responsible for much of the reported abuse.    The abuse of Avinza is at an all time. As this problem spreads, it is very important to understand the effects of the drug as well as the available treatment options.

It is an FDA approved Schedule III Controlled Substance, but because it is a barbiturate, the use of this drug can be habit-forming. Physical and psychological dependence as well as tolerance may occur if the drug is taken for prolonged periods of time or in case of high doses.    The disheartening observation is that some people start abusing butalbital and other barbiturates at a young age. The user in most cases does not know what they are getting themselves into. Reality only sets in when the young user is unable to live without the drug and withdrawal symptoms become evident.  <h2>Sign and Symptoms of Butalbital Addiction</h2>  A number of signs and symptoms when noticed indicate addiction to butalbital and the need to seek medical attention. Typical <strong>butalbital addiction</strong> symptoms may include:  <ul>  	<li>Lying to doctors about headache severity or pain in order to get higher prescriptions</li>  	<li>Mixing butalbital and alcohol or other drugs to feel a better ""high""</li>  	<li>Using the drug more times or in larger amounts than is prescribed</li>  </ul>  While the above symptoms are important indicators of butalbital addiction, they are usually only visible to the user. Some other symptoms are visible to people around the user. Such symptoms are mainly behavioral in nature and may include one or more of the following:  <ul>  	<li>Isolation</li>  	<li>Mood swings</li>  	<li>Secretive behavior or lying</li>  	<li>Inexplicable aggression or hostility</li>  	<li>Borrowing or Stealing or money or medication from other butalbital users</li>  </ul>  Other signs and symptoms occur when a person stops using butalbital medications abruptly. The withdrawal symptoms often occur within 8 to 36 hours of the last dosage and can last up to 7 days. They include one or more of the following symptoms:  <ul>  	<li>Increased heart and respiratory rates</li>  	<li>Elevated body temperature</li>  	<li>Increased blood pressure</li>  	<li>Nausea and/or vomiting</li>  	<li>Anxiety or nervousness</li>  	<li>Raised consciousness</li>  	<li>Difficulty breathing</li>  	<li>Ringing in the ears</li>  	<li>Severe headache</li>  	<li>Disorientation</li>  	<li>Delirium</li>  	<li>Tremors</li>  	<li>Fatigue</li>  </ul>  Although rare, more potent withdrawal symptoms can include seizures and abnormal vital signs.  <h2>Effects of Abusing Butalbital</h2>  Butalbital is a general central nervous system depressant that can be habit-forming. It is commonly misused and abused with users becoming tolerant to the drug. Taking large amounts of the drug can even lead to death.    Besides the health effects of abusing the drug, drug users also become ineffective in their work places because of disorientation and thus careers can be destroyed. Another effect is misuse of money that could have been channeled to more useful income generating activities. Abusing butalbital can also strain relationships because abusers can become aggressive and hostile.  <h2>Butalbital Treatment</h2>  Persons fighting addiction to butalbital need the services of a rehab center. Residential treatment rehabs are meant for patients who require round-the-clock attention. Persons who have tried to end their addiction in vain or those who have overdosed in the past should opt for residential treatment. Outpatient services on the other hand are suitable to individuals whose addictions are still in the developmental phase. Their addiction is therefore still under control.    If you strongly feel that you will be unable to stop using the drugs without the help of round-the-clock medical care, then a residential treatment program is your best option. Additionally, persons, suffering from severe dependency or addiction or those with other physical or mental disabilities are best served at an inpatient rehab facility.  <h2>Statistics of Butalbital Abuse</h2>  According to the DailyMed, most addicts take about 1500mg per day of butalbital. The dosage can however vary depending on the tolerance levels of a particular user. It is very easy to become tolerant to the drug and addicts keep on increasing their dosage to feel intoxicated. These might reach lethal levels. When butalbital is combined with alcohol, it becomes even more dangerous and the lethal dosage level is greatly reduced."

102,"Carisoprodol (or Soma) Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",carisoprodol-or-soma-overview-signs-and-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/01,"In the early part of 1959, a drug that was originally believed to have antiseptic properties was developed by Frank Berger. In the June of the same year, leading pharmacologists from America met to have a discussion regarding this drug, which was aptly named as Carisoprodol. It was discovered to have other properties like relaxation of muscles.    The original goal of the developers of the drug at Wallace Laboratories was to obtain a variant of Meprobamate; in an attempt to get it to have great muscle relaxing properties while simultaneously reducing the risk of overdose and abuse. It is popularly known as Soma.  <h3>Overview of Soma</h3>  In addition to being a muscle relaxer, the drug acts as an agent of relief from pain for patients who have sustained injuries, or those who suffer from muscular or skeletal conditions that are painful. Together with other therapy procedures like rest and massage of the affected tissues, this drug is usually very effective in blocking the transmission of pain stimuli to the brain, via the central nervous system.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Carisoprodol Abuse</h2>  Due to the sedating properties of Soma to the patient, there is susceptibility of people who use it for long periods and develop a dependency on the drug. Another factor which makes it a potential candidate for abuse is the fact that it is anxiolytic in nature. This means that it may be used as a recreation drug, in conjunction with some narcotics and numerous opioid drugs.    Moreover, it does not show up in most drug screening tests. In addition, it may be used for spiking drinks, since it makes the patient to be very relaxed (hence some people use it as a date rape drug). For these reasons, there have been numerous instances when Carisoprodol was being moved by countries as a restricted or a controlled substance.    People who are actively addicted to Soma have several symptoms. For starters, the patient experiences bouts of unclear thinking and even the disruption of clear expression of emotions. They go through stress and disruption of their sleep, which becomes more pronounced during the withdrawal periods.    The addicted person sometimes displays mood swings and if mixed with alcohol, increases the degree of dizziness or drowsiness. Carisoprodol is a habit-forming drug so it is very important to use it only with a prescription - meaning that no other person uses it apart from the patient for whom it was intended and at the prescribed dosage.    When trying to discontinue the use of Soma, the first step is to let the physician know that you intend to stop using it and research recommended addiction treatment centers.  <h2>Effects of Carisoprodol Abuse</h2>  The immediate effect of Soma when used as a recreational drug is giving the patient a sense of euphoria, which is sometimes called the Soma 'high'. This can be lethargic and deeply hypnotic, making the users likely to use it habitually. The short-term effects include:  <ul>  	<li>Vision impairment</li>  	<li>Improper coordination</li>  	<li>Dizziness and mood swings</li>  	<li>Nausea/Vomiting</li>  	<li>Chills</li>  </ul>  There are a horde of effects that come as consequence of using Carisoprodol in the long term. The most notable of these is the tightening of the chest cavity, leading to difficulties in breathing. Many more health problems accost the body after a long-term use of the drug.  <h2>Carisporodol Statistics</h2>  The abuse potential for the patients, as indicated by research, indicates that women are more likely than men to become habitual users of Soma. It was noted that after the patients were discontinued from prescriptions, more than 47% continued procuring them from outlets like chemists. The bottom line is that Carisporodol can potentially be abused."
105,"Chlordiazepoxide Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",chlordiazepoxide-overview-signs-and-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/01,"Chlordiazepoxide (called methaminodiazepoxide) was first benzodiazepine to becom synthesised in the mid of 1950s. Chlordiazepoxide was the synthesised on a quinazolone 3-oxides, chemical dye from work. It was found by accident when in 1957 evaluations revealed the compound had anxiolytic, hypnotic and muscle relaxant effects. Three years later chlordiazepoxide was marketed under the brand name Librium as a curative benzodiazepine drug. Under the brand name Valium diazepam hit the marketplace following chlordiazepoxide, in 1963 - and was followed by many additional benzodiazepine compounds over decades and the following years.    In 1959 over 2,000 doctors and more than 20,000 patients used it. It was described as ""chemically and clinically distinct from the tranquilizers, psychic energizers or other psychotherapeutic drugs now accessible."" During studies, chlordiazepoxide caused muscle relaxation and a calming effect on lab animals like rats, mice, cats, and dogs. Aggression and anxiety were removed in much smaller doses than those essential to create hypnosis. Chlordiazepoxide is much like phenobarbital in its anticonvulsant properties. Yet, it lacks the hypnotic effects of barbiturates. Animal evaluations were conducted in the San Diego Zoo and the Boston Zoo. Forty-two hospital patients admitted for long-term and acute alcoholism, and various psychoses and neuroses were treated with chlordiazepoxide. In a large part of the patients, stress and motor delight were ""efficiently reduced."" The most favorable results were found among alcoholic patients. It was reported that dermatologic problems and ulcers, both of which including psychological variables, were reduced by chlordiazepoxide.    Indication and symptoms include:  <ul>  	<li>Confusion</li>  	<li>Constipation</li>  	<li>Drowsiness</li>  	<li>Passing Out</li>  	<li>Changed sex drive</li>  	<li>Liver issues</li>  	<li>Lack of muscle coordination</li>  	<li>Small menstrual problem</li>  	<li>Eruptions or Skin rash</li>  	<li>Swelling because of fluid retention</li>  	<li>Nausea</li>  	<li>Yellow eyes and also skin</li>  </ul>  <h2>Effects of Abusing Chlordiazepoxide</h2>  Continual use of benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide leads to the growth of fortitude with a decline in amount of benzodiazepine binding sites in mouse forebrain. The Committee of Review of Medicines who carried out an extensive review of benzodiazepines including chlordiazepoxide found and were in agreement with the Institute of Medicine and the decisions of a study carried out by the White House Office of Drug Policy and the National Institute on Drug Abuse that there was little evidence that long-term use of benzodiazepines were valuable in treating sleeplessness because of the growth of fortitude. Benzodiazepines tended to lose their sleep boosting properties within 3-14 days of constant use and in treating stress the committee found that there was little persuasive evidence that benzodiazepines kept effectiveness in treating stress after 4 months constant use on account of the growth of fortitude.    Chlordiazepoxide can cause physical dependency, dependency and what's currently called the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal from other or chlordiazepoxide benzodiazepines regularly results in withdrawal symptoms that are much like those found with barbiturates and alcohol. The higher the dose and the more the drug is taken the greater the danger of experiencing withdrawal symptoms that were unpleasant. Withdrawal symptoms can nevertheless happen at normal dosages and additionally after short-term use.    Take this drug orally as directed by your physician. The dosage is dependent on your own age, medical condition, and reaction to treatment. Use this medicine exactly as prescribed. Don't raise your dose, take it more often or use it for a longer duration of time than prescribed because this drug can be habit forming. In addition, if used for a length period of time, don't suddenly stop using this drug without your physician's approval. Some states may become worse when the drug is suddenly discontinued. Your dose may have to be slowly decreased to avoid side effects like seizures. When used for a protracted period, this drug may not work as well and may require different dosing. Chat with your physician if this medicine stops working well."

109,"Clonidine Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",clonidine-overview-signs-and-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/01,"Do you have any idea about Clonidine drug? Well, if you have no idea, here are some of the few things you really have to know about it. First of all, it refers to a sympatholytic kind of medication that is normally used to treat anxiety disorders, high blood pressure, hyperactivity disorder, migraine, diarrhea, menopausal flushing and also certain pain conditions. To add on that it is classified as a centrally acting imidazoline receptor and a2 adrenergic agonist that is well known to have been in clinical use for more than 40 years.    Clonidine along with the popular methylphenidate has been identified that it can treat ADHD. In the year 2010, Food and drug administration approved the clonidine to be used either as a monotherapy or an adjunct specifically to traditional stimulant therapy in treating ADHD.    In the beginning of 1960s, somebody known as Boehringer Ingelheim decided to synthesize a certain peripherally active kind of adrenergic compound specifically for nasal decongestion just like any other simple nose drops. In that case, Imidazoline- derivatives containing some decongestive properties are known to be substituted amidines whereby amidine function is normally incorporated into imidazoline structure. However, at that particular time, ÐCH2 Ð bridge replacement by an ÐNH Ð group had not been actually achieved chemically especially in compounds which are substituted at both 6- and 2- phenyl ring positions. Later, the problem was solved by introduction of chlorine atoms as the main substituents. Though the resulting drug had a remarkably high decongestive and vasconstructive effect at mainly at low concentrations, it resulted that the other effect was seen to be more significant. Once the administration of the drug to a certain secretary was over, she felt asleep for 24 hours, marked bradycardia, and dryness of the mouth and also developed a low blood pressure. Clonidine was developed later simply because of its lowering effect and it was introduced into clinical routine in the year 1966.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Clonidine Abuse</h2>  Clonidine is usually considered to be a centrally acting type of alpha- agonist hypertensive agent and it is generally used for treating high blood pressure. Also, a doctor may also decide to prescribe clonidine for treating Tourette's syndrome, severely painful cramps especially during menstrual period, hypertensive crisis and many others.    Basing on the statistics from the U.S National Library of Medicine, a certain study showed that 10 out of 15 selected individuals who had sought the dependence of opiate treatment acknowledged that they had actually abused clonidine in order to decrease the heroin amount that was needed to achieve the recommended effect and more so to prolong its duration action.    Clonidine overdose can result from may be taking more than prescribed dosage by the doctor.    The common signs of clonidine overdose include:  <ul>  	<li>Slow heart rate</li>  	<li>High blood pressure</li>  	<li>Fainting</li>  	<li>Coma</li>  	<li>Drowsiness</li>  	<li>Weakness</li>  	<li>Constricted pupils</li>  	<li>Sinus</li>  	<li>Bradycardia</li>  	<li>Cold and pale skin</li>  	<li>Tiredness</li>  	<li>Slurred speech</li>  	<li>Shivering</li>  	<li>Difficulty in breathing</li>  </ul>  These symptoms of overdose can be very serious and they can even result in death.  <h2>Effects of Abusing Clonidine</h2>  Some of the common effects of Clonidine include:  <ul>  	<li>Flu symptoms</li>  	<li>Swelling and rapid weight gain</li>  	<li>Fast or in other words pounding heartbeats</li>  	<li>Slow heart rate</li>  	<li>Urination problems</li>  	<li>Feeling that you might run short of breath even with a mild exertion</li>  </ul>  Other side effects include:  <ul>  	<li>Mild fever</li>  	<li>Change of moods</li>  	<li>Insomnia, nightmares</li>  	<li>Dry mouth</li>  	<li>Loss of impotence, sex and also difficulty in having an orgasm</li>  	<li>Diarrhea, constipation and pain in the upper part of your stomach</li>  	<li>Feeling hot</li>  	<li>Headache</li>  	<li>Cold symptoms like stuffy or runny nose, cough, sneezing and sore throat</li>  </ul>  <h2>Clonidine Statistics</h2>  In conclusion, according to clonidine statistics, out of about 10, 060 recorded overdose exposures that was between the year 1993 and 1999, 57% were children younger than six years and 34% involved children between 6 to 12 years. The Philadelphia Children's hospital advises that this particular drug is currently becoming one of the popular agents which are most responsible for coma especially in young children. Clonidine addiction can have some very serious results and it can even be fatal. Most of the people are using it without even knowing its purpose and later they will end up having some problems just because they did not follow the right way of using this drug. So, before using this drug, it is of great importance to know more about this drug in order to avoid having problems in future."
111,"Codeine Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",codeine-overview-signs-and-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/01,"Codeine is one of the most popular and widely used opioid narcotics worldwide. It is an opiate primarily used for its antitussive, analgesic, sedative, antidiarrheal, anxiolytic, antidepressant, antihypertensive, and hypnotic properties. As a member of the opiate class, codeine is derived from the opium-poppy plant. Opiates include a number of other drugs like Vicodin, heroin, OxyContin, hydrocodone and Demerol.    Codeine is prescribed by doctors to treat mild to moderate levels of pain, treat occasional gastrointestinal problems and manage a pesky cough. Most individuals who take the drug as per the doctor's prescription do not find any problem, but some people get addicted to it due to abusive or uninformed use.    Used to manage chronic pain, Codeine as an opiate is becoming the substance of choice for many addicts. In fact, it is one of the most commonly abused drugs due to its powerful effect on the user.    In addition to pain relief, very high doses of Codeine could lead to pleasurable euphoric sensations in the user. When Codeine enters the central nervous system, it activates the reward system in the brain, allowing excessive release of the pleasure hormones.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Codeine Abuse</h2>  The signs and symptoms of the Codeine abuse vary from person to person, depending upon the total length of time the drug has been abused by the user. Other factors include amount used, and frequency of use. Some of the most common signs and symptoms of the Codeine abuse are:    Mood Symptoms:  <ul>  	<li>Depression</li>  	<li>Euphoria</li>  	<li>Sense of well-being</li>  	<li>Calmness</li>  	<li>Anxiety</li>  	<li>Emotional numbing</li>  	<li>Mood swings</li>  </ul>  Behavioral Symptoms:  <ul>  	<li>Feeling socially withdrawn</li>  	<li>Social isolation</li>  	<li>Forging prescriptions</li>  	<li>Doctor shopping</li>  	<li>Fixation on codeine</li>  	<li>Frequent ER visits</li>  	<li>Stealing or borrowing from loved ones and friends</li>  	<li>Healthcare fraud</li>  	<li>Financial problems</li>  	<li>Apathy</li>  	<li>Indifference towards loved ones social activities and job.</li>  	<li>Legal problems</li>  	<li>Buying codeine on the web</li>  	<li>Faking health reports to obtain more drugs</li>  	<li>Interpersonal relationship problems</li>  	<li>Sleepiness</li>  	<li>Poor work performance</li>  </ul>  Physical symptoms:  <ul>  	<li>Blue colored tinges on fingernail beds and lips</li>  	<li>Dizziness</li>  	<li>Constipation</li>  	<li>Low blood pressure</li>  	<li>Decreased sex drive</li>  	<li>Itching</li>  	<li>Respiratory depression</li>  	<li>Seizures</li>  	<li>Fainting</li>  	<li>Dry mouth</li>  	<li>Rashes</li>  	<li>Urinary retention</li>  </ul>  Psychological symptoms:  <ul>  	<li>Delusions</li>  	<li>Decreased memory</li>  	<li>Worsening of the mental health</li>  	<li>Psychosis</li>  	<li>Hallucinations</li>  	<li>Increased mental illness</li>  	<li>Lack of emotions</li>  </ul>  <h2>Effects of Abusing Codeine</h2>  While Codeine is an effective drug that helps relieve symptoms of pain, there is no doubt that the drug is being abused commonly by people, without even knowing its effects on their body and mind. Like any other addiction, excessive use of Codeine could lead to devastating health problems. Long-term use of any medication, whether for good or worse, often results in uncontrollable urge to consume more. When not taken under medical supervision of a trained physician, such addictions can increase and lead to complications in terms of both psychological and physiological aspects.    Many people who abuse this drug for a long time become tolerant to its mild effects and start abusing heavier narcotics such as benzodiazepines, to get the feelings of greater highs. Here are some effects of short, as well as long-term use of Codeine:  <ul>  	<li>Acute pancreatitis</li>  	<li>Cold, clammy skin</li>  	<li>Decreased muscle tone</li>  	<li>Kidney damage</li>  	<li>Financial problems</li>  	<li>Major depression</li>  	<li>Liver damage</li>  	<li>Legal issues</li>  	<li>Heightened pain sensitivity</li>  	<li>Domestic problems</li>  	<li>Job loss</li>  	<li>Seizures</li>  	<li>Uncontrollable muscle twitches</li>  	<li>Impaired social relationships</li>  	<li>Incarceration</li>  	<li>Respiratory depression</li>  	<li>Bradycardia</li>  	<li>Coma</li>  </ul>  Codeine addiction is one among the most serious disorders known in the field of medical that can cause suffering for everyone involved. Immediate medical treatment is necessary to reduce its ill-effects.  <h3>Effects of Withdrawal</h3>  If someone is physically dependent on Codeine must not discontinue the use of it without medical supervision. The immediate cessation can cause a number of withdrawal effects. These are:  <ul>  	<li>Craving for more drug</li>  	<li>Runny nose</li>  	<li>Goosebumps</li>  	<li>Racing thoughts</li>  	<li>Hallucinations</li>  	<li>Intense sweating</li>  	<li>Chills</li>  	<li>Stomach cramps</li>  	<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>  	<li>Psychosis</li>  	<li>Suicidal thoughts</li>  	<li>Muscles spasms</li>  	<li>Agitation and irritability</li>  	<li>Homicidal thoughts</li>  </ul>  <h2>Statistics of Codeine</h2>  Specific statistics on the use of Codeine is still not well known. However, opiate narcotic use is becoming a growing concern for many countries, forcing the authorities to take immediate and strict measures to control the problem. It has been estimated that over 33 million American people use Codeine for non-medical purposes each year. Sadly, only 20% are able to successfully complete their rehab and change their lives for better."
114,"Concerta Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",concerta-overview-signs-and-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/01,"Concerta is a nervous system stimulant that affects the chemicals of the brain and nervous system. This drug is similar to cocaine although the effect lasts longer with mythylphenidate, even though it is not as potent. Concerta can also be compared with Ritalin, however, Ritalin releases half of the mythylphenidate immediately and the other half 4 hours later, whereas Concerta releases the other half 12 hours after it has been taken. This type of medication is used mostly for kids with ADD or ADHD. Nevertheless, it can be used up to the age of 65 when necessary. Consider Concerta as a fundamental part of treatment which is used to treat psychological problems, social and educational disorders. Keep in mind that certain drugs can interact with each other and therefore should not be used within 14 days after using a MAO inhibitor.    There are quite a few things you should rethink before taking this medicine, for instance:  <ul>  	<li>If you are allergic to mythylphenidate</li>  	<li>Suffer from glaucoma</li>  	<li>If there is any family history of Tourette syndrome</li>  	<li>You suffer from severe anxiety or agitation</li>  </ul>  All of the above mentioned allergies or disorders may be increased when Concerta is used. There are numerous cases where stimulants were the cause of sudden death situations as well as heart attacks. This normally surfaces in people with heart disease or defects. Make a note that this medicine should never reach someone with a history of drug or alcohol abuse. Mythylphenidate should be taken as prescribed and, more importantly, during the morning hours in order to prevent sleep loss.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Concerta Abuse</h2>  Concerta (Mythylphenidate) is considered a drug of abuse:  <ul>  	<li>An overdose can be fatal and needs to be reported immediately to the poison help line.</li>  	<li>Avoid driving under the influence of mythylphenidate as this might interfere with your ability to focus.</li>  	<li>Do not use any form of alcohol when you are on Concerta as this will cause mythylphenidate being released too fast into the bloodstream.</li>  </ul>  Signs and symptoms that should cause awareness and immediate attention:  <ul>  	<li>Experiencing chest pains</li>  	<li>Fainting while using this drug</li>  	<li>New or worse mental and behavior problems surface</li>  	<li>When a new or worse bipolar illness occurs</li>  </ul>  Signs of overdosing and long-term abuse:  <ul>  	<li>Aggression</li>  	<li>Personality change</li>  	<li>Seizures</li>  	<li>Rapid heart beats</li>  	<li>Vomiting</li>  	<li>Muscle pain that cannot be explained</li>  	<li>Extreme sweating</li>  	<li>Restlessness</li>  	<li>Uncontrollable panic states</li>  	<li>Dehydration</li>  	<li>Delusions</li>  	<li>Swelling of ankles and hands</li>  	<li>Numb fingertips often is a sign caused by swelling</li>  	<li>Depression</li>  	<li>Hallucination</li>  	<li>Tremors</li>  	<li>High blood pressure</li>  	<li>Abdominal pain</li>  	<li>Kidney damage and Rhabdomyolysis</li>  	<li>Overly active reflexes such as twitching</li>  	<li>Addiction can cause psychosis, which is very difficult to distinguish from schizophrenia</li>  </ul>  Normally when the aforementioned side effects occur the drug is discontinued for future use (for that person). Unfortunately there is no cure for addiction and it should be reduced gradually. Withdrawal is psychological, however if the drug is discontinued with immediate effect it may lead to severe depression, extreme fatigue or even suicide for adults. If this drug has been used for a long time it may also cause heart disease.  <h2>Concerta Statistics</h2>  Statistics have shown that over 17 million children worldwide are using this drug or a similar one just as dangerous. The unfortunate truth about this is that over 10 million children out of the 17 million worldwide are from the United States. The use of antidepressants has rapidly increased since 1995 up until 1999, so much so that there was a 580% increase in children under the age of six and a 112% increase in ages seven to twelve. Children as young as four have tried to commit suicide and children in the age group of five have commit suicide."
117,"Damason-P Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",damason-p-overview-signs-and-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/01,"Damason-P is synthetic drug consisting of aspirin and hydrocodone. The drug is commonly used to treat moderate to severe pain. Hydrocodone is the component that makes the drug highly addictive. Hydrocodone is a narcotic pain reliever and one of the most frequently prescribed opiates. According to studies it is more effective than codeine as a cough suppressant and is as good as morphine when it comes to relieving pain. Normally patients who are closely monitored by physicians hardly get addicted to it; however DEA claims that recreational use of the drug is quite common.    The drug is classified as a narcotic analgesic together with aspirin. Aspirin belongs to a category of drugs known as salicylates and has been used an antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory medication for years. Damason-P should not be administered to teenagers and children especially if the children suffer from symptoms of flu or chickenpox. Administering it to children may cause negative effects including Reye's syndrome, a condition associated with intake of aspirin or aspirin-containing medication during a viral infection such as chickenpox or Influenza.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Damason-P Abuse</h2>  Abuse of the drug is as result of the physical effects of the drug. When absorbed in the body this opiate clings on the opiate receptors in the spinal column and the brain. This not only lowers the sensation of pain but also gives a feeling of well being in the user. If the user continues to take the drug, higher doses are needed to attain the same level of euphoria. Eventually psychological and physical dependence develops. When this occurs the person experiences a strong craving for the drug.    Dependency on this drug happens when a person cannot function normally without using it. People who exhibit the following signs and symptoms are likely to be dependent on this drug:  <ul>  	<li>Using the drug without doctor's prescription</li>  	<li>Taking too much drug at one time</li>  	<li>Disregarding the doctor's instructions when taking medication</li>  	<li>Continuing to use the drug even when it is no longer necessarily</li>  	<li>Mixing the drug with other substances such as alcohol</li>  </ul>  Users who overdose on Damason-P experiences the following:  <ul>  	<li>Abdominal pain</li>  	<li>Heartburn and headache</li>  	<li>Dizziness, vomiting and nausea</li>  	<li>Dry mouth</li>  	<li>Coughing blood</li>  	<li>Depression</li>  	<li>Fatigue</li>  	<li>Dark urine</li>  	<li>Clammy and cold hands</li>  	<li>Breathing difficulties</li>  	<li>Jaundice</li>  	<li>Hallucinations</li>  	<li>Seizures</li>  	<li>Hearing problems/ringing noise in the ears</li>  	<li>Abnormal heart rate</li>  	<li>Blue fingernails or lips</li>  </ul>  <h2>Short and Long-Term Effects of Damason-P Addiciton</h2>  Short-term effects of the drug often seem harmless and even beneficial. Since this is a pain-relieving drug, users do not experience pain when they get high. A number of users report a pleasant numbing sensation throughout the body. This is a common effect of most narcotics. In some instances users claimed that they felt a simultaneous warming of the stomach and the rest of the body with a pleasant cooling feeling in the lungs. When describing how a Damason-P high feels like, users reported feelings of euphoria; however the most popular effect comes from using the drug for pain management. Since this is a prescription drug and doctors usually prescribe it for patients experiencing moderate or chronic pain, the drug brings the much needed relief. This is the main reason why it is so easy to abuse.    Addiction is among the most dangerous long-term effects of using this Damason-P as it affects the personal life of the addict. Drug addiction usually wreaks havoc on family relationships, causes mental health complications and difficulties at work. Other long-term effects of this drug include physical problems such as liver damage and hearing loss. Death may occur with the continued use of the drug especially when the use takes an overdose.  <h2>Damason-P Drug Statistics</h2>  Addiction to Damason-P presents a troublesome situation because it is a prescription drug. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) reports that doctors gave out about 140 million prescriptions for drugs containing hydrocone (a major component in Damason-P) in 2010. This put hydrocone at the top of the list of prescribed opiates in the US. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking to curb the abuse of prescription pain relievers by requiring pharmaceutical companies to educate doctors about the risks of long-acting and extended-release forms of the drugs. According to FDA commissioner, Dr. Margaret Hamburg, prescription drug abuse is the fastest growing problem in the US. Studies conducted by Yale University shows that about 12% of teenagers have abused prescription drugs. The study leader warned that unless something is done fast the number of young people addicted to prescription drugs may become a major challenge in future."

121,"Darvon Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",darvon-overview-signs-and-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/01,"Darvon is a narcotic that is used to relieve pain in the body. Typically, Darvon, or as it is known in the medicinal science field - dextropropoxyphene, is usually prescribed by a doctor to a patient who is experiencing some sort of mild to moderate fits of pain in their body. The main function of Darvon is to prevent the body's pain receptors from sending signals to your brain, reducing the amount of pain that you feel.    This drug was patented back in 1955 by its manufacturer Eli Lilly and Company. When the drug was first introduced to the public, it was approved by the United States Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA). It wasn't until 2010 that the drug was recalled permanently, pulled out of the general market areas of the United States, and illegal to prescribe to patients. The drug was pulled off the market because researchers discovered that the drug radically changed the electrical activity of the heart of the person who was taking the drug. This change in electrical activity in the heart caused abnormal rhythms in the heartbeat, and sometimes it would even cause cardiac arrest.    Darvon cannot be prescribed by doctors anymore, but it is becoming a very popular recreational drug in the United States. For recreational use, the drug is known by its multiple street names. These street names include ""N's"", ""Pink Footballs"", ""65's"", and ""Yellow Footballs"".    This drug is very dangerous, especially when used recreationally because it is very addictive. This increase in recreational use has many worried because both the short and long-term effects can be quite devastating to a person, both physically and mentally.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Darvon Abuse</h2>  Darvon abuse can come with a lot of different symptoms and signs of abuse.

130,"Desoxyn Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",desoxyn-overview-signs-and-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/01,"Desoxyn is a prescription drug that stimulates the central nervous system. It is a pharmaceutical form of methamphetamine hydrochloride. This drug is mainly used for treating Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). It helps in increasing attention and decreasing hyperactivity and impulsiveness in ADHD patients. Desoxyn is mainly used for treating obesity coupled with low calorie diet of obese individuals that have not lost weight using other forms of weight loss therapies.

All the requests were acknowledged by NDA and Desoxyn was approved for use in December 1944.    The only marketing indications that are remained for methamphetamine short term control of exogenous obesity and ADHD. A preparation of methamphetamine that was in plastic-matrix tablet form was released and it was known as Desoxyn Gradumet. However, the production of this formulation by Abbott ceased in 1999 due to manufacturing difficulties.    Excessive doses of Desoxyn can lead to addiction. Patients who stop taking the drug after using high doses for an extensive period may also experience withdrawal symptoms. These include depression, sleep disorders, and extreme tiredness.

134,"Dexedrine Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",dexedrine-overview-signs-and-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/01,"Dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) is used in treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) but only as part of an entire treatment plan, including social, psychological, and other treatments. Its use may help increase the ability to pay attention, stay focused, or stop fidgeting and concentrate.    It may also be used to treat a particular sleeping disorder (narcolepsy) and help a patient stay awake at daytime. However, it shouldn't be used in treating tiredness or holding off sleep in those with no sleep disorder.    Dexedrine is indicated as a key component of a total treatment program for ADHD particularly in patients age 6 and above. A total treatment program for the typical ADHD may at times include medication, counseling, as well as other therapies.    Dexedrine belongs to a class of medications known as ""stimulants."" Apparently, stimulant medication, the most commonly prescribed treatment for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, is believed to work by influencing certain chemicals in the human brain.    While Dexedrine may help increase concentration, it also decreases impulsiveness in a patient with ADHD.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms Dexedrine Use</h2>  Nausea, diarrhea, stomach upset, cramps, nervousness, loss of appetite, dry mouth, headache, dizziness, weight loss, irritability, trouble sleeping, sweating, and restlessness may occur. However, if any of the above-mentioned effects persist or worsen, contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately.    In rare cases, this medication may raise blood pressure. Therefore, it is advisable to check your blood pressure on a regular basis and inform your doctor or pharmacist of any high results.    You should also seek medical attention right away if you experience any serious side effects, including: chest/jaw/left arm pain, shortness of breath, severe headache, fast/pounding/irregular heartbeat, fainting, weakness on one side of the body, seizures, confusion, slurred speech, and blurred vision.  <h2>Effects of Abusing Dexedrine</h2>  Sudden deaths, stroke, and myocardial infarction cases have been reported in adult patients taking stimulant drugs at normal doses for ADHD. While the actual role of stimulants in these cases is unknown, adults do possess a greater likelihood of experiencing serious structural cardiac abnormalities, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, or other serious cardiac problems than children do. Adults with such abnormalities need to avoid using stimulant drugs for treatment.    However, all patients need to be monitored for larger changes in their heart rate and blood pressure. In addition, caution should be practiced when treating patients whom increases in heart rate and blood pressure might compromise underlying medical conditions, for instance, those with recent myocardial infarction, heart failure, pre-existing hypertension, or ventricular arrhythmia.  <h2>Dexedrine Statistics</h2>  Harvard's study of narcotic's use without prescription on college campuses indicates that in the year of study the proportion of students who admitted to using Dexedrine/ similar stimulant amounted to 4%. Other campuses recorded up to 25% stimulant abuse. In 2009 alone, emergency room visits involving stimulants such as Dexedrine were over 92,000. In addition, the study conducted by medical researchers in 2005 indicated that about 25% of college students were reported to have taken Dexedrine even without their doctor's prescription."
138,"Dextroamphetamine Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",dextroamphetamine-overview-signs-and-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/01,"Dextroamphetamine is typically used to treat disorders like narcolepsy and ADHD (attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder); however it may also be used for situations that might not be indicated on the bottle. These include stroke recovery, depression, autism, fragile X syndrome and developmental disabilities. Due to the psychostimulant and amphetamine stereoisomer components it's a very potent medication that can easily become a habit to use, even when none of the above disorders are present.    Dextroamphetamine is distributed under several brand names such as Dexamphetamine, Dexedrine and Dextrostat. Even though when it's used correctly it can serve a great purpose, but the moment it becomes an addiction the consequences are rather severe.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Dextroamphetamine Abuse</h2>  There are several signs and symptoms that can result due to Dextroamphetamine abuse. The following are typical indications that Dextroamphetamine is becoming a substance of addiction:  <ul>  	<li>Irritability</li>  	<li>Nausea</li>  	<li>Sexual disorders</li>  	<li>A decreasing level of motor skills</li>  	<li>Hallucinations</li>  	<li>Dry mouth</li>  	<li>A lack of appetite, leading to dramatic weight loss</li>  	<li>Diarrhea or constipation</li>  	<li>Increase in blood pressure</li>  	<li>Compulsive behavior</li>  </ul>  <h2>Short-Term and Long-Term Effects Dextroamphetamine Addiction</h2>  The difficulty with determining the short and long term effects of Dextroamphetamine addiction are based on the fact that the body quickly adapts to Dextroamphetamine, which means a higher dosage will constantly be needed. How quickly a person will start to suffer from the effects will also differ from individual to individual. The short-term effects more often than not develop physically, while long term users suffer from psychological problems as well.  <h3>Physical Damage</h3>  Although chances are slim that an overdose can be fatal, it remains a possibility. However, there is a great chance that chronic use will cause great physical danger such as:  <ul>  	<li>Difficulty with breathing</li>  	<li>Gastrointestinal problems and ultimately distress</li>  	<li>Severe chest pain</li>  	<li>Migraines and headaches</li>  	<li>Cardiovascular damage</li>  	<li>An unstable heart-rate</li>  	<li>An unhealthy loss of appetite</li>  	<li>Dizzy spells and sometimes even fainting</li>  </ul>  <h3>Psychological Damage</h3>  <ul>  	<li>This usually occurs when long term abuse is involved, although it's not exclusive to the latter.</li>  	<li>A significant change in mood will occur. This means uncontrollable mood-swings and emotions.</li>  	<li>Depression and anxiety become more intense and happens more often.</li>  	<li>Paranoia which typically turns into hallucinations.</li>  	<li>Psychosis can occur and greatly resembles Schizophrenia.</li>  </ul>  <h3>Personality Damage</h3>  Apart from the fact that addiction will change numerous mental and physical attributes, it tends to inflict changes on the personality as well. Just as depression stops a person from participating in any activity, so does Dextroamphetamine abuse. Over the course of a couple of months it will render a person unwilling to spend time or talk to friends. In addition it will make enjoyable tasks not worthwhile anymore.    As mentioned before, for some all these effects become relevant after a few weeks. For others it might take a couple of months. Nevertheless, these effects will come into play at some time or another and there is no way to predict which comes first.  <h2>Dextroamphetamine Withdrawal Symptoms and Addiction Treatment</h2>  This addiction is difficult to treat, because tolerance and the psychological dependence can be extensive. Obviously cravings will occur, but an array of other symptoms will also surface. Fatigue and an increase in appetite can definitely be expected, along with insomnia or hypersomnia. Depression tends to be part of the recovery process as well as anxiety. After 24 hours of stopping withdrawal starts. The withdrawal process isn't necessarily long, but there are still some dangers involved. The person who is withdrawing can become a danger to him/herself and it's always recommended to attempt recovery at an accredited treatment and detox facility. They have the expertise to make the process as painless as possible and they can provide the needed support. There is no question that family and friends play a big part in beating any addiction, but they might not be capable of handling the medical or psychological complications that may occur. It goes without saying that the emotional distress isn't pleasant.  <h2>Dextroamphetamine Statistics</h2>  According to recent findings at least 25% of college students use Dextroamphetamine without a prescription. It starts as a study aid, but adopts the characteristics of typical street drugs in terms of getting a fix. High school students to which it's prescribed are 3 times more likely to become addicts compared to students who never use it. College students that experiment with Dextroamphetamine are 7 times as likely to start chronic use."
140,"Dextromethorphan (DXM) Overview of Signs, Symptoms and Effects",dextromethorphan-dxm-overview-of-signs-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/01,"One of the most common ingredient in cough remedies is dextromethorphan (DMX).

142,"Dextropropoxyphene Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",dextropropoxyphene-overview-signs-and-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/01,"Dextropropoxyphene refers to an analgesic drug that belongs to the group of medicines known as opioid, patented (1955) and its manufacturer is Eli Lilly &amp; company. It is meant for the treatment of mild pain aside from its local anesthetic and antitussive effects. Approximately, around 10 million people have used this drug however; it has been taken off the market both in the US and in Europe as well as in some other countries like India. This is because of the concerns of heart arrhythmias and fatal overdoses resulting from its abuse.  <h2>History of Dextropropoxyphene</h2>  This drug is related to methadone and it was initially commercialized with the brand name Darvon in 1957. It was used widely in the 1970s under this brand name to treat the withdrawal symptoms of opiate.    The main ingredient in this drug is Dextropropoxyphene hydrochloride. As mentioned above, it is in the category of opioids which resemble the effects of pain reducing chemicals called endorphins that occur naturally. They work by combining with opioid receptors in the brain and then blocking the transmission of pain signals. Although the cause of the pain may still remain, the actual pain felt will definitely reduce.    When it is in its pure form, opiate addicts to relieve their withdrawal symptoms use it. It is only used as a partial replacement since it is weaker than other abused opioids. It is used to relieve physiological withdrawal symptoms (and even muscle spasms) despite the fact that it does not have much effect on mental cravings.    Caution should always be taken when using it with children, pregnant/lactating women, elderly people, people with kidney or liver problems, those with Addison's disease and even those with enlarged prostate glands. It is advisable to consult a doctor before using it.  <h2>Side Effects Dextropropoxyphene Use</h2>  Below are some of the side effects experienced from the use of this drug.

144,"Dextrostat Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",dextrostat-overview-signs-and-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/01,"Dextrostat is a form of Dextroamphetamine, which is a potent of amphetamine steroisomer and psychostimulant prescribed to patients to treat ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) both in adults and children. It has been linked to affect the brain and nerve chemicals that are responsible in contributing to impulse control and hyperactivity. It is also used to treat narcolepsy, a sleeping disorder that causes excessive daytime sleeplessness. Dextrostat is also commonly used in the military during fatigue inducing missions that require alertness. This drug is available to people as a generic drug sold under various brands like Dextrostat. Taking the drug in very large doses can cause Dextrostat overdose symptoms including dependence, addiction, and tolerance.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Dextrostat</h2>  Overdosing on an amphetamine isn't commonly known for causing fatal experiences. However, it can lead to other serious symptoms. Moderate overdoses can induce:  <ul>  	<li>Irregular heartbeat</li>  	<li>Painful urination</li>  	<li>Confusion</li>  	<li>Low or high blood pressure</li>  	<li>Muscle pain</li>  	<li>Hyperthermia</li>  	<li>Severe agitation</li>  	<li>Tremors</li>  	<li>Urinary retention</li>  	<li>Rapid breathing</li>  </ul>  Large overdoses can produce symptoms including:  <ul>  	<li>Amphetamine psychosis</li>  	<li>Anria</li>  	<li>Adrenergic storm</li>  	<li>Cerebral hemorrhage</li>  	<li>Cardiogenic shock</li>  	<li>Extreme fever</li>  	<li>Renal failure</li>  	<li>Edema, circulatory collapse</li>  	<li>Stereotypy</li>  	<li>Serotonin toxidame</li>  	<li>Rapid muscle breakdown</li>  </ul>  Fatal amphetamine poisonings can typically also involve convulsions or a coma. Over abuse of amphetamines could result in an occurring stimulant psychosis that might be present along with a number of systems such as delusions, hallucinations, and paranoia.    Other minor side effects and symptoms to Dextrostat like many other prescription medications can include the following:  <ul>  	<li>Headache</li>  	<li>Insomnia</li>  	<li>Unpleasant or bitter taste buds</li>  	<li>Restlessness</li>  	<li>Diarrhea</li>  	<li>Weight loss</li>  	<li>Constipation</li>  	<li>Uncontrollable tremors or shaking throughout the body</li>  	<li>Decreased appetite</li>  </ul>  Taking low and moderate amounts of Dextrostat can also create the phenomena of feeling stronger, the need to repeat simple acts, as well as the experience of abrupt shifts in actions or thoughts.

They may require receiving the following:  <ul>  	<li>Sedating medicines that will calm down the patient</li>  	<li>Activate charcoal to help down the absorption of the contents in the drugs to their bloodstream</li>  	<li>Stomach pumping or gastric lavage to help mechanically remove all unabsorbed drugs that may be in the stomach</li>  	<li>IV fluids to help restore and balance up the bases, minerals, and acids in their system</li>  </ul>  Before any action is done to treat the victim, it is vital to contact a medical professional as soon as possible so that as they are being treated, medical professionals will be on their way to help.    The long-term effects that Dextrostat may have on patients are that it may cause them to be dependent to what it does to their body. Withdrawal symptoms will occur immediately after one stops taking the drug. While addiction definitely is a very serious risk with certain recreational amphetamine uses, it's unlikely to arise during short-term medical use. As for long-term abuse, tolerance to the medication increases, creating this need to boost the dosage to achieve its original effect to the body. Withdrawal will happen within the first day of discontinued use of the drug.    Symptoms of withdrawal include:  <ul>  	<li>Dysphoric mood</li>  	<li>Lucid or vivid dreams</li>  	<li>Fatigue</li>  	<li>Insomnia or hypersomnia</li>  	<li>Anxiety</li>  	<li>Drug craving</li>  	<li>Increased or decreased movement</li>  </ul>  Withdrawal occurs from the degree of dependency that has been created from the drug.    Before the use of Dextrostat, it is vital to consult a medical professional about your personal situation and needs. Do not take any Dextrostat unless it is prescribed and advised by your doctor or trusted physician. Educate yourself about the effects it can have to your body and how it will either benefit or damage your system before it is used."
146,"Diazepam Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",diazepam-overview-signs-and-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/01,"Diazepam also known Valium is a benzodiazepine that is only used under a prescription by medical practitioners to treat conditions such as alcohol withdrawal symptoms and muscle spasms as well as anxiety disorders. It some cases Diazepam is prescribed alongside other drugs used to treat seizures.    The drug works by replacing chemicals produced in the brain and rapidly slowing down any electrical activity that is abnormal. When an individual uses it for long periods, it brings about feelings of relaxation that has been sighted as one of the reasons why Diazepam is so addictive. You may fail to notice it at first but after using the drug for a long time, your body develops a resistance.    In the long run, Valium starts to change the structure and functionality of the nerve cells found in the brain. When it gets to this point, the brain is no longer able to produce the necessary chemicals for the it to function properly, which in extension means that users become physically dependent. Individuals who are physically dependent on Diazepam take the drug in large doses so as to compensate for the reduction of chemicals in the brain, which eventually leads to addiction.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Diazepam Addiction</h2>  Realizing that you have a Diazepam addiction may take time until you develop some sort of dependency on the drug. Some of the initial symptoms of the drug affect the body and mind. The symptoms include mood, behavioral, physical and physiological changes.    Mood Symptoms include:  <ul>  	<li>Irritability</li>  	<li>Bewilderment</li>  	<li>Anger</li>  	<li>Sadness</li>  	<li>Behavioral Symptoms</li>  	<li>Change in the individual's appearance due to lack of personal hygiene</li>  	<li>Loss of appetite</li>  	<li>Slowed movements</li>  	<li>A tendency to use the drug more than once everyday</li>  	<li>Frequent visits to the doctor</li>  	<li>Getting the drug from different pharmacies</li>  	<li>Taking part in risky behaviors</li>  	<li>Slower response to stimuli</li>  </ul>  Physical Symptoms include:  <ul>  	<li>Feeling drowsy</li>  	<li>Restlessness coupled with muscle weakness</li>  	<li>Blurred or double vision</li>  	<li>Dizziness, drooling and dry mouth</li>  	<li>Constipation</li>  	<li>Nausea</li>  	<li>Slurred speech</li>  	<li>Spinning sensation</li>  	<li>Psychological Symptoms</li>  	<li>Memory loss and lack of sleep</li>  	<li>Poor judgment and loss of inhibitions</li>  	<li>Contemplating to commit suicide</li>  	<li>Hallucinations</li>  </ul>  While these might not be the only symptoms associated with Diazepam, they are an absolute proof that an individual is suffering from an addiction and it's imperative to get in touch with a doctor for medical advice.  <h2>Short Term Effects of Diazepam Abuse</h2>  The short-term effects out of Diazepam abuse are experienced relatively fast when the drug is abused. The obvious first time effect is feeling what the drug's high is like. Other effects include:  <ul>  	<li>Reduced brain activity - This brought by a delay in the way messages are relayed by the brain's transmitters leading to an uncoordinated sensation.</li>  	<li>Euphoric Feeling - The main reason why most people abuse Diazepam is to get high. When the effect is at its peak, the individual feels a rush of good or drunken feeling. However, the high is followed by a crash and the mellow feeling starts to disappear as the brain activity is normalized.</li>  </ul>  Other short-term effects experienced when the initial high crashes include increased heart rate, stomach cramps, depression and fever. Most users work against the crash by taking more Diazepam so as to slow down the body. The user wants to feel happy again as soon as possible. Without knowing, the user becomes more and more dependent on the drug and soon or later can't stay without using it.  <h2>Long-Term Effects of Diazepam Abuse</h2>  After using the drug for several months a user can become an addict. The brain rapidly becomes reliant on the depressed effects of the drug to carry out its functions properly. The addict simply thinks that he or she needs the drug to face the life's challenges. One dose after the other, the amount of Diazepam needed to maintain a high increase. As this cycle of physical and psychological dependence goes on, the user develops others long term effects such as:  <ul>  	<li>Incarceration, legal problems and social isolation</li>  	<li>Mood swings, inability to carry out tasks that the user once enjoyed which ultimately leads to money problems</li>  	<li>Coma and in cases of extreme overdose sudden death is possible</li>  </ul>  <h2>Withdrawal Effects of Diazepam</h2>  Diazepam is usually associated with very dire withdrawal effects which are not exclusive to the addicts only but to patients who take the drug longer than their bodies can tolerate as well. While patients may recover from withdrawal signs soon, addicts who stop to use the drug all of a sudden may have to be placed under a watchful eye of a doctor or a medical detox facility.    If withdrawal symptoms are not handled in the correct manner, they can be life threatening. They include:  <ul>  	<li>Hallucinations and aggressiveness</li>  	<li>Panic disorders, seizures and tremors</li>  	<li>Psychosis and dysphoric manifestations</li>  	<li>Status epilepticus; a life threatening disorder where the brain is in constant state if seizure</li>  	<li>While withdrawal signs have to be treated under the care of a medical doctor, the addict can be refereed to a rehabilitation center if he or she is not responding treatments.</li>  </ul>  <h2>Diazepam Statistics</h2>  The precise statistics for this drug are not accurately known. However, there has been a variation of statistics about benzodiazepines, the category in which Diazepam belongs.    In 2010, it was estimated that more the 2.6 million people used a benzodiazepine for reasons that were not necessarily medical every month. A nationwide research conducted in 2006 revealed that the drug was widely used in emergency rooms. The research also discovered that out of over 23.5 million people who required treatment for the drug's addiction, only 2% actually received it.    Diazepam addiction can be treated if medical help is sought early enough. Patients using the drug for medical reasons can have the dosage adjusted to help them deal with withdrawal signs. Bearing in mind that addiction to this drug is most of the time associated with abuse of other drugs, a comprehensive treatment plan is recommended. Counseling sessions for individual addicts can help them deal with psychological effects of addiction.    All in all, the drug has numerous effects on the human body and long-term use should be avoided. If prescribed use the drug as per the doctor's prescription and avoid temptations to take more than prescribed. If you're an addict, help can be found and you can completely recover from the addiction."
149,"Dicodid Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",dicodid-overview-signs-and-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/01,"Dicodid or hydrocodone is a prescription drug that is used to suppress coughing and relieve pain. It is classified as narcotic analgesic and works in a manner that is similar to codeine. However, Dicodid is stronger than codeine and may cause addiction if it is used for an extended period of time. This is one reason why quite a few doctors will not prescribe the drug unless their patient is suffering from severe pain.    Dicodid can cause addiction in as little as six months. This is because the medication produces a sense of euphoria and changes in mood. Hydrocodone is one of the medications that are monitored by the American Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). Some patients who cannot get the medication in pharmacies may buy it on the streets from dealers, where it is known as Vikes, Hydro and Norco.    People who abuse Dicodid put themselves at risk for becoming dependent when they use it for longer periods than they have to or take more doses daily than their doctor recommends for them. The DEA has stated that some doctors are still not taking the risk of abuse seriously. This is because some physicians have their patients on the medication for over thirty years without proposing alternative methods of treatment.    The DEA is pushing for tighter control on medications such as Vicodin and Dicodid, which contains hydrocodone. One of their goals is to at least limit the length of time that a patient is prescribed the drug for to three months. Presently, doctors can write as many as five prescriptions for hydrocodone in six months. This period is long enough for someone to become addicted. The DEA also wants to prevent nurse practitioners and physician assistants from being able to prescribe the drug. The problems associated with the medication have made some doctors reluctant to even see patients who are on the medication for arthritis and other painful conditions.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Dicodid Abuse</h2>  There is a serious risk of addiction among patients who use Dicodid. If you have a family member of friend who uses this prescription drug, there are several signs that you should look out for including:  <ul>  	<li>Neglect of responsibilities at home or work</li>  	<li>Problem with personal relationships</li>  	<li>Lack of motivation</li>  	<li>Financial problems</li>  	<li>Previous prescribed dosages are no longer sufficient to deal with pain</li>  	<li>Moodiness and irritability when patient does not take the drug</li>  	<li>Cravings</li>  	<li>Thoughts of how to get more Dicodid</li>  	<li>Patient feels as thought they cannot live without the drug</li>  </ul>  If you have been prescribed Dicodid and you find yourself increasing your dosage without your doctor's supervision, it is likely that you are becoming dependent on it. If you are spending more than you should on the medication, visiting several doctors to get prescriptions or are lying to your doctors or members of your family in order to get more of the drug, you should seek help as soon as possible.  <h2>Long and Short Term Effects of Abusing Dicodid</h2>  In the short term, Dicodid can cause vomiting, nausea, a lack of concentration and low energy levels. It also causes:  <ul>  	<li>Headaches</li>  	<li>Constipation</li>  	<li>Slowed breathing</li>  </ul>  In the long term it causes:  <ul>  	<li>Chills</li>  	<li>Drug dependency</li>  	<li>Restlessness</li>  	<li>Stomach cramps</li>  </ul>  Dicodid and other medications that contain hydrocodone can result in death. Zohydro, an extremely strong formulation of the drug, can cause death if a person who has never taken opioids before takes just two tablets. A child can die from swallowing just one capsule of this hydrocodone-based drug. The high that a patient gets from using that form of hydrocodone can last up to twelve hours.  <h2>Statistics of Dicodid Abuse</h2>  The Center for Disease Control (CDC) has data that shows that deaths from Dicodid and other opioids have quadrupled in just 10 years. Since 1999, more than 17,000 people have died from overdoses resulting from opioid misuse. At present, more than 5 million Americans are addicted to opioids such as Dicodid. In the United States, 75% of drug overdose deaths are due to hydrocodone, oxycodone or methadone.    Deaths from these analgesics surpass the combined number of people who have died from cocaine and heroin overdoses. Addiction treatment must be used to help patients who have become dependent on this drug to get back on their feet. If you need help with overcoming Dicodid addiction, you should call a helpline or get in touch with a treatment center or professional as soon as possible."
151,"Di-Gesic Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",di-gesic-overview-signs-and-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/01,"Di-Gesic is a pain reliever that is used for treatment of moderate or mild pain. Its active ingredients are paracetamol and dextropropoxyphene and its generic name is dextropropoxyphene hydrochloride. It's a synthetic opioid analgesic that is related to methadone. Its components act on the nervous system for pain relief. 1 to 10% of Di-Gesic users experience side effects such as nausea and vomiting, dizziness and sedation and 0.1 to 1% of its users experience more unpopular side effects like hallucinations, mood-change, headaches, weakness, skin rash, constipation, visual disturbances and stomach pain.    It is not uncommon for people to abuse the prescription drug. Some people do it knowingly by getting it from non-medical or prescription based sources, others exceed their dosage while others start sharing prescription with their friend's without a doctors assessment. This is very dangerous and the outcomes could be detrimental because it more often than not the abuse of Di-Gesic leads to dependency on the drug.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Di-Gesic Addiction</h2>  The following are signs and symptoms that you could be going through or you could have observed on someone close to you that could indicate an addiction to Di-Gesic. The list also shows both short term and long term effects of abusing the drug:  <h3>An uncontrollable need to take bigger doses than what has been prescribed</h3>  This presents in the form of big cravings that makes the effect of the dose prescribed by the doctor inadequate. The person might keep taking larger and larger amounts to achieve a certain high and it becomes worse with time. The cravings become impossible to ignore because failure to continue taking the drug according to your body demands leads to sicknesses like headaches, weakness, abdominal pains, and skin irritations.  <h3>Faking sickness to acquire the drug, stealing the drug or borrowing of the drug even when not sick</h3>  If you have a strong desire to lie so that you can get Di-Gesic, this indicates addiction. People who suspect their loved ones are addicts should keep track of their medication to see if any is missing.  <h3>A sudden desire to participate in risky behavior and activities and lifestyles</h3>  A person abusing Di-Gesic might all of a sudden start getting thrills in participating in activities like over speeding without caring whether they get into accidents and harm themselves or others, sleeping around with multiple sexual partner without being concerned with whether they get or spread deadly sexually transmitted diseases. A person might also party for days without sleeping or eating which has adverse effects on their overall health but they never seem to notice or care.  <h3>Complete personality changes and serious mood swings</h3>  A person who used to be kind and gentle might turn into a vicious and rude person who has no regard for others even their own kids. The person becomes incredibly selfish and disappears for days and does not care who they hurt in the process. They might also become hot-tempered and very irritable with the slightest provocation.  <h3>Refusal to continue with normal routine</h3>  A person who was very hardworking and motivated may suddenly lack the desire to do normal activities like going to work, taking a shower, eating or participating in activities and hobbies they liked doing before. This loss of the willpower and just wanting to stay in bed or locked up in the house is a dangerous sign because it could also indicate depression.  <h3>Hallucinations</h3>  The abuser might start having perceptions of things or occurrences that are not real. For instance, someone could start hallucinating that someone wants to kill them. The person in this stage could become a danger to themselves and might end up harming the person in self-defense hence harming the person or getting hurt in the process.  <h2>Di-Gesic Addiction and Treatment</h2>  If your life is spiraling out of control, it is not the end of the world. There are many rehab facilities and counselors available to help you with your journey to recovery once you acknowledge your problem and seek help. Most of the time, drug abusers are the last to realize that they need help and it is the duty of their loved ones to trigger the process by staging interventions. Once the abuser is fully aware, treatment can start by detoxifying Di-Gesic out of their system and thereby get guidance of how to avoid triggers to relapsing."
153,"Dilaudid Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",dilaudid-overview-signs-and-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/01,"Dilaudid is not the typical painkiller prescribed to a patient needing relief for moderate to severe pain. Not as well known as its more prescribed contemporaries such as Hydrocodone and Vicodin, Dilaudid has the potential to be as addictive as heroin. Dilaudid, often called hydro-morphine is not the first choice painkiller prescribed by a physician due its extreme power and addictive habit forming nature.    The medication prescribed for moderate to severe pain should only be taken as directed by a physician. Not a common drug prescribed to a patient for long-term pain control monitored extremely close by the prescribing physician, Dilaudid is 8 times the strength of morphine.    Invented in 1924 by a German scientist, Dilaudid was officially marketed years later by the drug company, Knoll. Its purpose of development became known as one of the largest backfires in pharmaceutical history. The intention was to develop a drug that would rein supreme over the potent drug, morphine, offering fewer side effects, the plan completely backfired producing just the opposite.    Although Dilaudid originated from morphine, the results from the scientific plan concluded with a drug that is more potent than heroin and as addicting as any painkiller available. Dilaudid is one of the most popular street drugs replacing heroin and Oxycontin. Nicknamed the fool drug, like heroin, it gives the user a sense of euphoria while relieving pain. Once the user experiences the euphoric feeling for the first time, the abuse begins as they continue to increase the dosage seeking that feeling again.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Dilaudid addiction</h2>  While Dilaudid is a widely used recreational drug, the majority of individuals addicted to the drug are individuals that have been legally battling pain management. Chemicals in the drug target each pathway of pain throughout the central nervous system altering the way the body copes with pain now and in the future. The action is lasting and profound, causing long-term dependency associated with extreme withdrawal pain and symptoms. Many symptoms are the same for narcotic addiction. Listed are some common known symptoms for Dilaudid:  <ul>  	<li>Sleepiness</li>  	<li>Low Breathing Rate</li>  	<li>Anorexia</li>  	<li>Constipation</li>  	<li>Nervousness</li>  	<li>Dizziness</li>  	<li>Mental or Physical Impairment</li>  	<li>Withdrawal Symptoms</li>  	<li>Depression</li>  </ul>  Unlike other narcotic opiates, those that abuse Dilaudid prefer to inject the drug rather than swallow a pill or snort the powder. The reason being the strength of the high is not as effective by pill or powder. Determining Dilaudid abuse is not always so easy. Along with the above mentioned details there are many other symptoms to keep an eye open for signs.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Dilaudid Abuse</h2>  The classic abuser will typically be drowsy, lightheaded or dizzy. You may hear them complain about having problems urinating due to the drugs slowing the kidneys down to extreme levels. Constipation is another classic symptom. Therefore, you may hear complaints of stomachaches or witness the abuser buying an excessive amount of laxatives. Nausea and vomiting with stomach pain is common.    The person high on Dilaudid will experience trouble breathing. Opiates suppress breathing, which could cause slow rhythms with disturbed sleep apnea. Dilaudid and other opiates kill people by suffocating with suppressed breathing. Also, due to injections being the favored manner of taking the drug, check for signs of track marks. These marks can be on the arms, legs or in other hidden areas.    Circulatory suppression, cardiac arrest and strokes have been noted due to overdose of Dilaudid. An individual that has an addiction to a drug will do everything possible to get it when they are in need. For some, living without water, air and food are easier than going without Dilaudid once they have become addicted to the drug. Once a person has experienced withdrawals from not having the drug to continue their use, they will convince themselves criminal acts to gain the drugs are worthy of not experiencing the withdrawals again.    Drug addiction has a chain reaction on one's life. It begins with telling yourself it's ok to take the drug and from there on it becomes a downward spiral. You may think you have fooled everyone, but, in reality, you are the only one fooled. Your integrity is the first thing drug addiction (associated with Dilaudid) is the first to take.    Addiction treatment centers are excellent options for getting your life back on track, but the hardest thing to gain back is your integrity and your self worth once you have ruined it with drug addiction.    Dilaudid, like other narcotics is good for what they are made for, controlling pain. It only takes one extra pill to become out of control addiction."
158,"Seconal Addiction - Signs, Symptoms and Effects",seconal-addiction-signs-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/02,"Seconal is a trade name of a barbiturate known as Secobarbital. Barbiturates are sedatives which slow down the central nervous system through their action in the brain. They raise the levels of γ-amino butyric acid (GABA), a brain neurotransmitter. This calms nerves, relaxes muscles, produces drowsiness and slows body processes.    Barbiturates were first discovered in 1903 in Germany. Within a few decades after their discovery, there were more than 2500 barbiturates but only 50 of them found their way to the market. Eli Lilly Company patented secobarbital in 1934 and later sold the rights to an Indian company, Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals. Today, Marathon Pharmaceuticals are the manufacturers.    Barbiturates are categorized into ultra-short-acting, short, intermediate or long-acting based on the time the drug takes to act and how long it remains in the body. Intermediate barbiturates such as Seconal are the most addictive and the government of the USA classifies the drugs as Controlled Substances Schedule II, meaning that they are very addictive but have some medicinal uses. Anyone caught dealing or in possession of Seconal without prescription from a doctor risks severe legal penalties. Shorter-acting barbiturates are classified Schedule III Controlled Substances while the long-acting barbiturates are classified Schedule IV, implying that they are less addictive.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Seconal Addiction</h2>  Seconal is classified as a short-acting barbiturate. The effects of the drug last for 3 to 4 hours after intake. Withdrawal symptoms can occur 8 to 12 hours after the previous dose of Seconal. An addict may experience the symptoms below:  <ul>  	<li>Anxiety</li>  	<li>Nausea</li>  	<li>Delirium</li>  	<li>Dizziness</li>  	<li>Vomiting</li>  	<li>Weakness</li>  	<li>Deep coma</li>  	<li>Convulsions</li>  	<li>Hypotension</li>  	<li>Rebound insomnia</li>  	<li>Distorted visual perceptions</li>  	<li>Tremors of the hands and fingers</li>  </ul>  <h2>Effects of Seconal Abuse</h2>  The effects of Seconal vary at different levels. At lower levels, Seconal effects are akin to alcohol while at higher levels, it produces sedation, sleep, coma or death. The drug alters cerebella function, decreases motor activity and depresses the sensory cortex leading to drowsiness, sedation and sleep.    The main short term effects of Seconal include constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, excitement, headache, memory loss, and a “hangover” feeling the following day. These may be accompanied by more potent effects such as restlessness, shallow or slow breathing, mouth sores, sore throat, fever, bleeding, bruising and nightmares.    Seconal is among the most fatal drugs since it has a low therapeutic to lethal ratio. A very small overdose can lead to death. Seconal was evident in the autopsies of Jimi Hendrix, Judy Garland and Marilyn Munroe; celebrities it is said died because of accidental overdoses of the drug.    Some persons have experienced life-threatening reactions the first time they took Seconal. Such people entered into an anaphylactic shock syndrome which includes hives, swelling of the throat and face, rashes, breathing difficulties, coma and death.    Seconal is an extremely addictive drug and once a person is addicted, the withdrawal process may be life threatening. This is why it advisable to seek help from experts during the recovery process.  <h2>Statistics of Seconal Abuse</h2>  Seconal was widely abused in the 1970s. The drug was very popular those days. People could take it to get a feeling similar to being drunk or to get sleep if they had insomnia because of abusing methamphetamine or heroin. The drug was easily available, highly soluble in alcohol or water and could be taken by injecting as well. These led to the massive abuses.    Today, Seconal and other barbiturates appear to be making a comeback especially because a lot of people are abusing prescription painkillers, an addiction which leads to insomnia. People are also experimenting with all types of prescription drugs in the wrong belief that such drugs are safer compared to street drugs. The increasing popularity of Seconal and other barbiturates can be attributed to physicians and pharmacies closely monitoring benzodiazepines and narcotic painkillers.    For example, in 1991, only 3% high school reported experimenting with sedatives compared to 7% in the recent past. According to a report by the Food and Drug Administration, around 5% of all drug overdose incidences and hospitalizations are due to barbiturates. Barbiturates are also becoming very popular in developing countries where abusers smoke the drug through pipes.  <h2>Treatments Options for Seconal Addiction</h2>  <strong>Seconal addiction</strong> is serious since it is easy to overdose and the withdrawal syndromes are equally life-threatening. No one should try to withdraw from the drug without seeking assistance from a residential treatment center; either a hospital clinic or a rehabilitation center where you are under the supervision of qualified practitioner."

162,"Speed Addiction - Signs, Symptoms and Effects",speed-addiction-signs-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/02,"Speed, also known under many other names such as meth, methamphetamine and chalk, is one of the most addictive stimulating drugs on the market. It was first created in Germany, in 1887, as a more basic form of the drug - amphetamine. Back then, its properties were not widely known and the research involving it didn't seem promising, so it was left with practically no use until the 1920s. As scientists started to research its stimulating effects, it became an instant ""miracle drug.” Speed was, in different forms such as inhalers, quickly used as an over-the-counter drug to cure almost anything, from depression to congestion.    Its current form, also known as methamphetamine, was developed in Japan in 1919. It could be purchased in tablets or injections and it was used for similar purposes as amphetamine, but because of its properties that enabled meth to be quickly dissolved in water or alcohol, it expanded all over the world.    However, this drug was not always forbidden. In the 50s it was widely prescribed as a cure for depression and as a diet aid. Its stimulating effects also quickly gathered the attention of athletes and college students, because it offered stimulation and endurance, be it for long nights of studying or better results in sports. With the widespread use and an increase in demand there was also an increase of illegal ""meth labs,” that provided the growing population of addicts with a non regulated source of methamphetamine. This, with the addition of many negative side effects making themselves known, led to the introduction of penalties for possession, production and distribution of Speed.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Speed Addiction</h2>  Signs and symptoms of methamphetamine use might not be visible at first sight. This is mostly because they strongly depend on how long and how much meth a person has been using. To approximately show what a Speed user might be like, we can divide them into three categories: low-intensity, binge, and high-intensity users.    Low-intensity users are not yet psychologically addicted. They can appear as completely normally functioning members of the community, sometimes a little bit jittery, hyperactive and very talkative. This is because they only use Speed as a stimulant, similar to caffeine or nicotine yet much more dangerous. They only use it whenever they feel that they will not be able to do everything that needs to be done in a short amount of time, so low-intensity users mostly consist of high-achieving individuals, be it on a professional or personal level. They administer the drug by snorting or swallowing it.    Binge users are already psychologically addicted. They are caught in a vicious circle of getting high by smoking or injecting Speed and then trying to maintain that first high for as long as possible. They enter into a state of intense hyperactivity, mentally and physically and it can last to up to 15 days. After they get down from the high, the abuser might resort to so-called tweaking - easing the depression and emptiness they feel with the use of alcohol or heroin (most common methods). This leads to a crash, where their body basically can't take it anymore, requiring massive amounts of sleep. This can last a few days. After that they function normally, until the need for the next binge strikes. The so called normal period decreases as the number of binge cycles increases.    High-intensity users are those, whose addiction has become a constant need for the first, the most intense high they achieved. They completely avoid sleep and they try to prevent the crash phase with any possible methods. This means they constantly pump the drug into their bodies, which eventually leads to some of the more severe symptoms of <strong>Speed addiction</strong> such as paranoia, hallucinations, tics and violent behavior.  <h2>Short and Long Term Effects of Speed Abuse</h2>  As previously stated, short-term effects of methamphetamine abuse can be similar to those of conventional stimulants - increased attention, decreased fatigue, increased activity, wakefulness and talkativeness. In addition meth use also decreases appetite, makes the user feel euphoric, it increases metabolism and heart rate.    Long term abuse however can have a lot more severe effects on the mind and the body. Individuals that regularly use Speed can become paranoid; they can develop hallucinations, repetitive motor activity, aggressive behavior and the feeling that their ""skin is crawling.” It can also leave its effects on the body, in the form of tooth decay, hair loss, weight loss and open sores that develop because the users are prone to scratching themselves.  <h2>Statistics of Speed</h2>  <strong>Speed addiction</strong> is one of the most difficult ones to cure. It takes anywhere from 30 to 90 days for the users to realize that they are in withdrawal, which means it takes even longer for their psychological addiction to go away. Research shows that 93% rehabilitated individuals return to regular use."
164,"Steroids Abuse - Signs, Symptoms and Effects",steroids-abuse-signs-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/02,"Use of Steroids continues to make sports and news headlines all over the world as body builders and athletes use them in an illegal manner to gain an advantage in their various fields. Anabolic Steroids refer to the hormones that are injected or taken orally influencing a person’s hormonal system in a bid to make extra testosterone. This is supposed to help increase the mass of muscles. This type of Steroids should not be confused with another kind known as Corticosteroids as these are used as anti- inflammatory medicine.    The drug can be traced back to the 1800’s despite the fact that Steroids did not receive an audience worldwide until the 29th century. In the 1860’s, in Amsterdam a group of swimmers were charged with using drugs in a bid to increase their speed. This did not stop here as for the next 80 years, athletes wanted to speed themselves up using stimulants. Testosterone the male hormone was synthesized in 1935. German soldiers were given this during the Second World War to enhance aggressiveness and performance out in the field. By 1940, the hormone was widely used for competitive sports but the dangers were not yet clearly known.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms Steroids Abuse</h2>  Initial signs that a person is on Steroids normally include unusual mood swings and rapid increase in weight. A person may also have mixed emotions which can lead to increased aggressiveness. In some cases, acne may also develop. Side effects of this drug are normally explained by the anabolic and androgen drug levels that are present in the body. Use of Steroids normally suppresses the testosterone that occurs naturally in the body. For this reason, other symptoms that a man can suffer from include:  <ul>  	<li>Decreased sperm production</li>  	<li>Decrease in the size of the testicle also known as atrophy</li>  	<li>Infertility</li>  	<li>Baldness</li>  </ul>  Females can also be affected by the increased level of testosterone production which can also lead to developing of a deep voice, changes in menstrual cycle and also increase in hair production. There are some women who may also experience baldness.  <h2>Effects of Abusing Steroids (Short and Long Term)</h2>  Use of Steroids has dreadful effects on various organs in the body such as:  <ul>  	<li>Liver damage- this often occurs which normally places an individual at risk of developing liver cancer. Increased numbers of sebaceous glands which can lead to development on acne on the skin.</li>  	<li>The heart is also at risk of damage in a number of ways. For instance, the heart muscles may become large in response to excess steroid in a person’s body. This enlargement is not good for the body as it can result in decreased pumping ability. This can also result in change in rhythm of the heart as change in electrical conduction also happens which can cause palpitations and sudden potential cardiac death.</li>  	<li>In addition to this, <strong>Steroids abuse</strong> may cause increased cholesterol levels, elevated blood sugars and high blood pressure all which are high risk factors for stroke and heart attack.</li>  	<li>There are also some psychiatric effects including depression and excitation. There are some users who may also suffer from violent episodes. In some cases a person may be affected by depression to the extent that they contemplate suicide.</li>  	<li>For adolescents who have not yet completely grown, using the drug may stop bones and stunt growth, muscles and joints from reaching their full maturity potential. Here premature sexual development can also occur. Other effects that may have not been mentioned above include: Oily skin and scalp. Jaundice (skin becoming yellow. Suffer delusions.</li>  	<li>Ladies can get reduced breast size, enlarged clitoris, masculinized female fetus and excessive body and face hair. Males may experience painful erections and/or become impotent.</li>  </ul>  <h2>Statistics of Drug</h2>  The use of Steroids has grown drastically over the years as there are very many people who feel like they need to use them to benefit from enhanced performance. They are normally used illegally to decrease fat, increase muscle and also improve the performance of an athlete not forgetting to mention their body appearance. It is important for people to learn that they can suffer from damaging side effects from using Steroids and it may also become addictive where you may go through withdrawal should you decide to stop using them. If possible, make sure you get help as soon as possible as prevention is better than cure."
166,"Stilnox (Zolpidem) Addiction - Signs, Symptoms and Effects",stilnox-zolpidem-addiction-signs-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/02,"Drugs play a big part in hospitalization and medication purposes that almost everyone already had one of them. They are prescribed by medical professionals depending on the patient’s need to overcome the current situation. Not everyone can have access to a variety of drugs, especially if it is rare and of high dosages. Prescriptions should be presented before a pharmacist allows a customer to purchase a specific drug not only for validation, but also to somehow control drug addiction.    Drug addiction is one of the major problems of any society today. Though drugs are really helpful in terms of medical purposes, the excessive usage may provide negative consequences or addiction. There are numerous crimes that are being reported these days that involves drug addiction, which is why every government are striving very hard to stop it, especially that most victims are children.    Though drug addiction is a chronic medical condition, there are treatments available for those people who are willing to change and be cured. Rehabilitation centers offer different types of processes in which some drugs are also involved. The patient or the family representative may choose among the processes.  <h2>The Most Common Addictive Drug</h2>  Stilnox, internationally known as zolpidem, is a sedative-hypnotic drug that is being used for treating patients with insomnia. This drug cannot be purchased without any prescription from medical professionals because it can be addictive in cases of substance abuse.  <h2>Where It Came From</h2>  Zolpidem came originally from a French pharmaceutical corporation known as Sanofi-Aventis. After experts already proven its positive effects as a sedative, it has been distributed to different countries such as Israel, United States, South Africa, United Kingdom, as well as Germany. It is in 2007 when the United States Food and Drug Administration procure zolpidem, believing that it will help the increasing number of patients with sleeping and behavioral disorder that seeks for help.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Stilnox (Zolpidem) Addiction</h2>  Research shows that the long-term use of zolpidem may result to withdrawal, central nervous system related detrimental effects, dependence, and tolerance. Zolpidem as well as other sedatives were originally recommended to be used in short periods of time and the lowest possible dose. A 10mg sedative drug should be used intermittently from 3-5 pills a week to consider a moderate use.    <strong>Stilnox (Zolpidem) addiction</strong> may contribute to severe health conditions such as excessive sedation and depressed respiratory system that is likely developing to comatose, or worse, death. The involvement of alcohol and depressants may even result to fatal cases of overdoses.  <h2>Effects of Abusing Drug (Short and Long Term)</h2>  Regardless if a person is moderately or excessively used the Stilnox, there are a number of withdrawal effects that is very unpleasant as well as life threatening for others. Here are some:  <ul>  	<li>Crying</li>  	<li>Vomiting</li>  	<li>Panic attacks</li>  	<li>Seizures</li>  	<li>Shaking</li>  	<li>Stomach cramps</li>  	<li>Nervousness</li>  </ul>  To avoid these withdrawal conditions, it is recommended to consult a specialist to supervise the sudden stop of using sedatives. There are more effective processes that can be used which are much safer as well as comfortable for the patients.  <h2>Statistics of Stilnox (Zolpidem)</h2>  In case zolpidem addiction happens, benzodiazepine, considered as an antagonist receptor drug can be used. This drug can only be injected into patients, which is why physicians are the only one who can perform the medication. The effects of benzodiazepine rapidly reverse the effects of the zolpidem, which will later on cure the addiction.    Since sedatives are proven to have a lot of negative addiction effects, they should be purchased only with the presence of a prescription. However, there are some online drug stores that offer like a regular drug that can be purchased over the counter. The price range of zolpidem is around $1.40 to $2.00 depending on the drug store if they have put a mark-up for the product.    Instead of jumping to conclusions and taking drugs without a professional’s advice, it is best to consult a physician first for possible medical treatments where drugs are not involved. Though there are treatments and drugs that can fight sedative addiction, it is not a valid reason to take drugs in general, through an irresponsible manner. It is true that drug addiction can be cured, but the fact that the human internal organs may easily deteriorate in case of substance abuse cannot be forgotten."
168,"Sublimaze (Fentanyl) Addiction - Signs, Symptoms and Effects",sublimaze-fentanyl-addiction-signs-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/02,"Sublimaze is a brand name of the generic drug called fentanyl. It is a powerful prescription drug used to treat mild to severe pain. It is often used before, during, and after surgical procedures. It is also often prescribed for patients who suffer from chronic pain, especially those who have cancer.    A potent synthetic narcotic drug similar to morphine, it is 100 times more powerful - 0.1mg of fentanyl is equal to about 10mg of morphine. It has become a popular illicit drug as millions of people all over the world use it for recreational purposes. It is even a more powerful and potent drug than heroin - with fentanyl being four times stronger than heroin in reducing pain.    The drug was approved by the FDA for injection in 1968 and comes in liquid form for injections, in pill, powder, and its most popular form - the patch. It is a controlled drug and can only be bought with a prescription from a qualified physician.    Because it is an opiate, Sublimaze or fentanyl is highly addicting. Users have a tendency to abuse it since its effect on the body is only short term - pain relief lasts for only about 8-12 hours. Authorities first reported cases of abuse in the mid - 70's and it was often mixed with other street drugs like heroin and cocaine in the 80's and sold as an expensive opiate analgesic. Combining it with these other drugs increases its potency and effects.    Its street names include China girl, China White, F, jackpot, goodfella, dance fever, murder 8, TNT, Cash, and Tango. In illegal form, Sublimaze and other fentanyl brands can be eaten as candy and smoked or snorted in its powder form.    They act just like heroin and morphine in that they stimulate the receptors in the nerves of the brain to increases your tolerance of pain by raising your threshold level and changing your perception of it. It acts to increase the levels of dopamine in the body - the pleasure neurotransmitter - giving you a state of euphoria and extreme relaxation. And because it gives you extreme feelings of pleasure, the more you use it, the more your body will crave it.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Sublimaze (Fentanyl) Addiction</h2>  A typical dose of Sublimaze is from 0.05 to 0.1 mg of fentanyl. Initial symptoms include:  <ul>  	<li>Feelings of relaxation</li>  	<li>Reduced feelings of pain</li>  	<li>Slow hear rate</li>  	<li>Lower blood pressure</li>  	<li>Dryness in the mouth</li>  	<li>Feelings of well-being</li>  	<li>Muscle weakness</li>  	<li>Hallucinations</li>  	<li>Lowered breathing</li>  </ul>  <h2>Effects of Abusing Drug (Short and Long Term)</h2>  Sublimaze is highly addicting and it is regarded as a very dangerous illicit drug. Most people under this drug develop a dangerous addiction that can cause severe psychological and physical distress. The administration of Sublimaze must be controlled and if preferred, under the expertise of a health practitioner in a hospital setting.    After 2 to 3 days of continued use, a person using it can develop a tolerance that will cause the desire and cravings for higher doses.  <h2>Short Term Effects</h2>  <ul>  	<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>  	<li>Dizziness</li>  	<li>Fainting</li>  	<li>Breathing complications</li>  	<li>Infection</li>  	<li>Irregular heartbeat</li>  	<li>Anxiety</li>  	<li>Swelling of certain body parts</li>  	<li>Sweating</li>  	<li>Hallucinations</li>  	<li>Drowsiness</li>  	<li>Fatigue</li>  	<li>Difficulty concentrating</li>  	<li>Alterations in mood</li>  	<li>Night sweats</li>  	<li>Intense allergic reactions</li>  	<li>Insomnia</li>  	<li>Hypertension</li>  </ul>  <h2>Long Term Effects</h2>  <ul>  	<li>Sleep apnea</li>  	<li>Bronchitis</li>  	<li>Liver damage</li>  	<li>Urination changes</li>  	<li>Diarrhea</li>  	<li>Abdominal pains</li>  	<li>Anorexia</li>  	<li>Amnesia</li>  	<li>Weakened immunity</li>  	<li>Seizures</li>  	<li>Depression</li>  	<li>Delusions</li>  	<li>Hallucinations</li>  	<li>Unconsciousness</li>  	<li>Coma</li>  	<li>Death</li>  	<li>Loss of interest in social activities</li>  	<li>Seclusion</li>  	<li>Inability to interact socially</li>  	<li>Damaged relationships</li>  </ul>  Because Sublimaze is very addicting, withdrawal symptoms can be so unbearable that weaning from the drug can be very difficult. Symptoms of withdrawal can be felt after only 4 hours off the drug and they peak after 3 days - causing severe symptoms that force abusers to get back on the drug.  <h2>Withdrawal symptoms include:</h2>  <ul>  	<li>Cold chills</li>  	<li>Restlessness</li>  	<li>Blurred vision</li>  	<li>Increased sensitivity to pain</li>  	<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>  	<li>Insomnia</li>  	<li>Delusions</li>  	<li>Muscle pains</li>  	<li>Depression and anxiety</li>  </ul>  The only way to wean <strong>Sublimaze (Fentanyl) addiction</strong> is go to a rehabilitation center where a gradual reduction of fentanyl dosage is given. For emergency situations, doctors can give the patient opioid agonists to counter the effects of fentanyl in the bloodstream.  <h2>Statistics of Sublimaze (Fentanyl)</h2>  Fentanyl as a street drug has become so prevalent and so dangerous that a study made by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention recorded over 1,000 cases of deaths due to fentanyl overdose and misuse from early April 2005 - late March 2007.    Despite being a very dangerous abused prescription drug, there were over 7 million prescriptions for fentanyl in 2008 alone, making the drug very accessible to addicts and abusers."
170,"Suboxone Addiction - Signs, Symptoms and Effects",suboxone-addiction-signs-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/02,"Suboxone, a medication that contains a combination of naloxone and buprenorphine, was first formulated in the United Kingdom in 1982 and approved for use in the US in 2002. This opioid medication was first used to treat severe pain.    Generally, an opioid is a narcotic substance, but Suboxone is a special narcotic medication that reverses effects of the other narcotic medicines, and so it is used as a treatment for narcotic addiction. It is important to note that this drug is not intended for use as pain medication. In addition, the drug may be used for other purposes that are not detailed in this article.    It is important to note that Suboxone may stop or slow your breathing. Therefore it should not be consumed in large quantities, or for longer periods than recommended by doctors. The product is designed to counteract effects of using narcotics at the same time when taking Suboxone. Therefore, the product works by reducing effects of a person withdrawing from use of drugs such as heroin or methadone. It also prevents narcotic overdose and prevents most narcotics from delivering euphoric effect, which prevents addicts from administering it.    Suboxone is usually available as a sublingual film and has a nice lemon taste. You can also find it available in form of tablets. The tablets are typically 8 mg and 2 mg.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Suboxone Addiction</h2>  <strong>Suboxone Addiction</strong> is quite rare. This is because it is mainly used in treatment of an opioid addiction. Consequently, the symptoms and signs of its treatment are more about normal side effects of its regular use. Just like Subutex, this drug contains buprenorphine, and therefore it is quite hard to overdose it. Its ceiling seems to max at about 32 mg. This means that even if you take higher doses, it will not produce measurable results. This makes its use safer. Its addiction ensures that effects of other opioids and opiates are blocked. However, this is a bit redundant as it has much higher affinity for opioid receptors. This makes the drug pointless to inject and thereby reduces its abuse. Generally, there is no definite treatment length. The treatment length depends on the addict’s situation.    The fact that it cannot be abused through injection, it does not imply that the unit is absolutely free of abuse. The drug may be taken without proper prescription and this amounts to illegal use. In addition, a higher amount than the prescribed one may be used. There are reported cases of mixing Suboxone with other drugs and alcohol, to give it more power.  <h2>Effects of Abusing Drug (Short and Long Term)</h2>  Since it is hard to abuse Suboxone, there are a few side effects reported. Naturally, there are effects such as standard side effects that include sleeping issues, irritability, jitteriness, and constipation. Other problems you are likely to suffer in the long term include flu-like symptoms when you want to withdraw. The following are the major side effects of Suboxone overdose:  <ul>  	<li>Respiratory problems. The problems will be indicated by higher risk of coma or death. This occurs when you are using the product with other medicines.</li>  	<li>Problems with coordination, dizziness, and sleepiness.</li>  	<li>Liver problems. You are advised to call a doctor if you notice any of the liver signs: white part of the eyes or skin turning into yellow, your urine turning dark, less appetite, nausea, or abnormal stomach pain.</li>  	<li>Allergic reaction. You are likely to notice hives, rash, swelling of your face, loss of consciousness and low blood pressure. In such a case you need to seek medical attention immediately.</li>  	<li>Opioid withdrawal. These are side effects you get when withdrawing from use of narcotics. They include watery eyes, diarrhea, runny nose, vomiting, muscle aches, and goose pumps.</li>  	<li>Decrease in the blood pressure. You feel dizzy when you get up very fast from lying down or sitting.</li>  </ul>  <h2>Suboxone Statistics</h2>  Suboxone was first approved in European Union to be used for treatment opioid addiction in 2006. In the US, it is approved by FDA. In recent years, the drug has been introduced in many other countries. As of November, 2012, it is estimated that sales worth more than $1.4 million had been made.    There are a number of reports saying that film formulation of Suboxone is safer than its tablet counterpart. However, these are reports that are yet to be approved by the relevant authorities."
172,"Subutex (Buprenorphine) Abuse  - Signs, Symptoms and Effects",subutex-buprenorphine-abuse-signs-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/02,"Subutex, along with Suboxone, is the product name for Buprenorphine, a substance used in the treatment of addiction, post-detox. In addition, buprenorphine was recently introduced as a transdermal formulation for treating persistent pain in the majority of European nations.    Though it is used to treat opium addiction, buprenorphine is itself a scheduled drug. In the European Union, Subutex's high-dose sublingual tablet preparations, were approved for opioid dependence treatment in the year September 2006. In the Netherlands, buprenorphine is a List II drug per the Opium Law, though guidelines and specific rules apply to dispensation and its prescription. In America, it was rescheduled from Schedule V to Schedule III drug before FDA acceptance of Subutex and Suboxone. Buprenorphine as a DEA ACSCN of 9064 and isn't subject to DEA annual aggregate production quotas.    Buprenorphine is generally used for the first 2 days after an individual has quit all other narcotics. Generally given in the office of a physician, it is best used sublingually, or as directed by a physician, once daily. Effectiveness can be severely compromised if the medication is chewed.    Buprenorphine works best when the first dose is started after hints of narcotic withdrawal have begun or at least 4 hours after last narcotic use. Buprenorphine may cause withdrawal symptoms if started too soon after the last narcotic uses.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Subutex (Buprenorphine) Abuse</h2>  <p style=""text-align: left;"">Keep in mind your physician has prescribed this drug because she or he has judged the advantage to you is greater than the danger of side effects. Many people don't have serious side effects. The most common side effects for <strong>Subutex (Buprenorphine) abuse</strong> are constipation, dizziness and lightheadedness. Over the counter solutions for constipation are usually effective.</p>  However, if Buprenorphine is injected or combined with other depressants (like alcohol, benzodiazepines including diazepam, other narcotics) the effects, such as respiration difficulties, can be serious, even lethal. Other serious interactions could result from combining Buprenorphine with narcotic antagonists (like naltrexone), certain narcotic pain medicines (mixed narcotic agonist-antagonists including butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine).  <h2>Buprenorphine: Effects of Abusing Drug (Long Term and Brief)</h2>  Knowing about the serious effects of mixing Buprenorphine with other illicit drugs makes it a very effective solution for persons who have made the serious commitment to remain drug free. However, there are several conditions that could make this drug less desirable, and so it is important the prescribing physician has a full medical history that would flag possible contraindications such as allergies, brain disorders (including head injury, tumor, seizures), breathing difficulties (like sleep apnea, asthma, also chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-COPD), liver symptoms, mood/mental disorders (including confusion, depression), stomach/intestinal problems (including blockage, constipation, diarrhea as a result of illness, paralytic ileus), trouble urinating (for example due to enlarged prostate).    In some cases, the physician can avert problems by prescribing a specified combination of buprenorphine/naloxone drug for care treatment. The mix with naloxone works exactly in the same manner as buprenorphine. It's joined with naloxone to prevent abuse (by injection) of the drug.    Since alcohol also raises the risk of breathing difficulties, it should not be combined with Buprenorphine.    Drug interactions raise the risk for serious side effects or may alter how medicines work. <strong>Subutex (Buprenorphine) abuse</strong> can cause the condition that changes the (QT prolongation) heart rhythm. QT prolongation can infrequently lead to serious (rarely fatal) rapid/irregular pulse and other symptoms (like acute dizziness, fainting) that want medical attention immediately."
174,"SymTan Abuse - Signs, Symptoms and Effects",symtan-abuse-signs-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/02,"This combination medicine is used for short-term treatment of cough and blockage due to the common cold, influenza, and other respiration sicknesses (e.g., sinusitis, bronchitis). The decongestants assist relief of ear blockage symptoms and stuffy nose. The component that is desirable for a high is a narcotic cough suppressant (antitussive). SymTan contains both codeine and dihydrocodeine, which make changes in the brain that reduce the craving to cough. The same changes are tied to both the chemistry that causes the high and the chemistry of withdrawal.    SymTan can lessen the effects of the common cold, but it will not cure or shorten the length of the cold. To reduce the danger of serious side effects, attentively follow all dosage directions. Ask about other methods to alleviate cold and cough symptoms (like drinking enough fluids, using a humidifier or saline nose drops/spray). Never use this medication to make a child drowsy.    Though dosage is dependent on factors like age, medical condition, and reaction to treatment, SymTan exhibits all the characteristics of a potentially addictive drug. Occasionally, unusual drug-seeking behavior is possible with this medicine, and by the usual methods of raising the dose, taking it more often, or using it for a longer time.    When used consistently in high doses for more than several weeks, SymTan will cause withdrawal responses, such as diarrhea, restlessness, perspiration, chills, nausea, and vomiting when usage is abruptly ceased. Consult a physician who can reduce the dose slowly to prevent withdrawal responses.  <h2>SymTan Abuse (Long Term and Brief)</h2>  Both codeine and dihydrocodeine are shifted into powerful narcotic drugs (dihydromorphine or morphine) in your body. In some individuals this occurs quicker and more fully than normal, which raises the danger of side effects that are quite serious. Some brands may include alcohol, sugar, or aspartame.    <strong>SymTan abuse</strong> may cause things such as headache, dizziness, drowsiness, upset stomach, constipation, nausea, nervousness, or difficulty sleeping may occur.    SymTan could cause serious mental/mood changes and respiration difficulties. Nevertheless, get medical help immediately if you see any symptoms &amp; signs of the serious allergic reaction rash, swelling/ itching (particularly of the face/ tongue / throat), trouble breathing, severe dizziness. Before taking this drug, tell your physician or pharmacist if you've got any other allergies. Caution is advised if you've got diabetes, alcohol addiction, liver disease, phenylketonuria (PKU), or another illness which requires you to restrict/prevent these materials in your diet. Ask your physician or pharmacist about using this product.  <h2>Statistics of SymTan</h2>  Drug interactions raise the risk for serious side effects or may alter how medicines work. The threat of tough side effects (like slow/shallow breathing, dizziness / severe drowsiness) if this medicine is mixed with the other products (like alprazolam, zolpidem, diazepam) can be dangerous. Symptoms of the overdose may include: confusion, clammy/cold skin, fainting, rapid/irregular pulse, slow/shallow breathing, and seizures. Some children can be sensitive to codeine or dihydrocodeine and have had quite serious (rarely fatal) respiration difficulties including slow/shallow breathing (see Side Effects section). Discuss the dangers and advantages of this drug with your physician or pharmacist."
176,"Temesta Addiction - Signs, Symptoms and Effects",temesta-addiction-signs-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/02,"Temesta refers to a benzodiazepine which is used to treat anxiety disorders. It is part of Lorazem International brand and is used off label for insomnia, alcohol detoxification, agitation, partial complex seizures and also as an adjunct in the antiemetic treatment. It is also used for status epilepticus in an intravenous manner.    Lorazepam was introduced in the year 1977 and it was intended to be used in the treatment of anxiety. It has all the six intrinsic effects of benzodiazepine; anterograde amnesia, muscle relaxation, anti-seizure, anxiolysis, antiemesis which reduces vomiting and nausea. However, it was also used for sedating hospitalized patients and also aggressive patients. It was also administered to patients who overdosed on drugs, especially the stimulant types to decrease the occurrence of seizures and agitation which were likely.    Temesta is supposed to be used exclusively by adult patients and its therapy should be started with the smallest yet effective dosage possible. The therapy should not exceed eight to around 12 weeks inclusive of the duration where the dosage is reduced. It should not be used for more than four weeks due to its dependence and tolerance. This drug has a high addiction rate with over a third of its users becoming addicts if they continue using it after four weeks. If it is used for long term treatment then it should be tapered off gradually in order to avoid withdrawal symptoms that are extreme. According to various researches in the United States, this drug is the most used prescription drug in many suicide attempts.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Temesta Addiction</h2>  Users of this drug for a long time will lead to addiction and there are some signs and symptoms that you should check in order to seek for addiction treatment. Most addicts try to cover up their situations and therefore it is important to be extra vigil in order to discover someone is an addict well in advance in order for them to get treatment. Some of the most common signs and symptoms of <strong>Temesta addiction</strong> include:  <ul>  	<li>Panic attacks</li>  	<li>Dilated pupils</li>  	<li>Agitation and restlessness</li>  	<li>Reduced concentration</li>  	<li>Mood fluctuations</li>  	<li>Weakness and fatigue</li>  	<li>Vomiting and nausea</li>  	<li>Bleary vision</li>  	<li>Flu-like symptoms</li>  	<li>Increased urinary frequency</li>  </ul>  Other signs that may point towards drug addiction will include someone ordering for drugs online, hiding the medicines, monetary problems that are unexplainable and inebriation signs. The withdrawal symptoms are more serious than the withdrawal symptoms associated with the other type of medications. They are seen after continued use and include the following:  <ul>  	<li>Hallucinations</li>  	<li>Dysphoria</li>  	<li>Panic attacks</li>  	<li>Delirium</li>  	<li>Coma</li>  	<li>Short term loss of memory</li>  	<li>Death</li>  	<li>Effects of Abusing the Drug</li>  </ul>  This drug has been known to impair the body balance and the steadiness used in standing leading to falls and fractures of the hips amongst the elderly. It also leads to confusion and hangover effects. It may cause depressions or even worsen a depression if the addict had depression earlier. There are some paradoxical effects that occur after continuous abuse and they include; aggression, increased hostility and angry outbursts. The effects are however dependent on the amount of dose taken, the higher the dose then the more adverse the effects will be.    Other effects associated with the abuse of this drug include suicide attempts. Even though it is used to treat patients with suicidal behavior, it can also increase that behavior if it is administered in high dosages in the treatment of depression. It should also be used with an appropriate antidepressant to reduce the increased suicidal behavior. This is one of the ways of making Temesta a safe drug and minimizing the side effects of the drug.  <h2>Statistics of Temesta</h2>  <ul>  	<li>Temesta withdrawal can happen within a week after using the therapy dosage.</li>  	<li>It is a schedule IV drug according to the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances and in the United Kingdom, it is classified as a Class C drug.</li>  	<li>It is reported that of all the 35% of drug related cases reported in emergency rooms, this sedative drugs are the most common.</li>  	<li>26% of all attempted suicides are also associated with the use of Lorazepam.</li>  	<li>It is also one of the most abused drug outside its prescription having been found to be number 3 of all the most commonly abused medicinal drugs.</li>  	<li>Most patients who use this drug mostly complain of some side effects; Unsteadiness at 3.4%, 4.2% weakness, dizziness 6.9% and 15.9% of the users complain of sedation.</li>  </ul>"
178,"Tramadol Abuse - Signs, Symptoms and Effects",tramadol-abuse-signs-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/02,"Tramadol is a centrally acting analgesic that is associated with a medicine class referred to as opiate agonist. It is recommended for use by a person that is in need of relief from pain. It is however not recommended for an individual that is intoxicated with other medicines that include sedative drugs, narcotic drugs, tranquilizers, depressants as well as medicines for psychological illnesses. To be certain that you can safely consume Tramadol, it is important to seek medical consultation from a doctor to be checked for other health problems which include liver diseases, kidney ailments, emotional ailments as well as digestive issues.    Taking Tramadol should be in accordance with prescriptions from a doctor. You should avoid taking it in increased doses or more than the prescribed period of dosage. Be sure to stick to the directions as indicated on the prescription tag. It is usually in capsule or pill form, so you should swallow it without chewing, grinding or busting it. Doing so can lead to dangers associated with an overdose or even death. When you are not using the pills, make sure that they are stored at room temperature.    Tramadol has been associated with conditions such as craving, development of tolerance as well as drug-seeking behavior. It has been shown to cause physical dependence in some patients that have a record of being dependent on opioids in the past. These conditions are not limited to patients that have got prior history of dependence on opioids. It is important to finish the dosage as recommended by a medical doctor, otherwise withdrawal symptoms may occur if you discontinue its intake.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Tramadol Abuse</h2>  Abuse of Tramadol can cause side effects that will be manifested using the following signs and symptoms:  <ul>  	<li>Shallow breathing</li>  	<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>  	<li>Euphoria</li>  	<li>Dizziness</li>  	<li>Drowsiness or sedation</li>  	<li>Constipation</li>  </ul>  You may also experience some withdrawal symptoms when you are using Tramadol to get pain relief. The symptoms include:  <ul>  	<li>Restless leg syndrome</li>  	<li>Nervous tremors</li>  	<li>Electric shock</li>  	<li>Lean muscle contracture</li>  	<li>Buzzing</li>  	<li>Anxiety</li>  	<li>Respiratory problem</li>  </ul>  Excessive abuse of Tramadol can cause addiction that could result into frustrating withdrawal effects which include depression, discomfort of the limbs, sweating, irritation and anxiety. It is therefore important to stick to the prescribed dose and go for regular checkups from a physician if you notice any side effects. This will help you take the drug while staying clear of the possibility of establishing reliance.    If you are addicted to Tramadol, there are therapies that you can undergo to help you overcome this condition. One of the things you will be required to do is fast detoxification of the drug whilst under the influence of an anesthesia. This will help to eliminate all opiates in the brain without experiencing serious withdrawal symptoms.  <h2>Statistics of Drug Abuse</h2>  Statistics show that rates of T<strong>ramadol abuse</strong> have increased since it was approved in 1994. The rates of abuse are possibly equal to the abuse of OxyContin, a time release formulation of the opioid oxycodone that is a favorite for many opioid abusers. OxyContin is essentially legal heroin. On the streets, Tramadol tablets are commonly referred to as ultras or chill pills. They are usually sold as alternatives for narcotics.    Even though Tramadol is not a traditional street opioid such as heroin or morphine, it can produce euphoria such as that produced by heroin with just a single dose of 75 milligrams. It is however important to note that this drug also comes with another one-time release aspect known as Extended Release, or ER, which can cause rapid addiction or sudden death.    Tramadol has a sour taste, but not like that of morphine and codeine. There are oral and liquefied varieties of the drug that have no flavoring, but the tablets usually have strawberry flavors.    If you have previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to Tramadol, it is advisable not to take it before getting proper advice from a medical doctor. People with history of epilepsy and seizures are also advised to seek consultation from a medical doctor before they use this drug. Even if you are using it properly, you should always watch out for signs and symptoms that could cause you to be addicted to it or experience any other side effects."
180,"Tramal Abuse - Signs, Symptoms and Effects",tramal-abuse-signs-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/02,"Tramal is a common drug that people misuse and soon find themselves addicted. Tramal used to relieve incidences of moderate to severe pain. It is categorized under synthetic opioid analgesics or pain relievers that have central action within the body. It is found in the form of capsules and injections. It contains inhibiting effects against the reuptake of serotonin-non epinephrine. However, it can also be prescribed for a different reason. If this is the case, you should get an explanation from your physician. As such, it should only be taken following a prescription by a doctor. Since all drugs are associated with both benefits and risks, it is important that all of them including Tramal are used appropriately. Failure to do this makes them likely to pose a number of dangers and complications.    Tramal, also known as Tramadol, was marketed by Janssen Pharmaceutical as hydrochloride salt. In the United States, it was marketed as Ultram while in Canada; it was marketed by Biovail as Ralivia. It was marketed and launched as Tramal by a pharmaceutical company in Germany. However, it is not considered a narcotic since it is not found under the Controlled substances Act.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Tramal Abuse</h2>  Tramal is used in the treatment of both acute and chronic moderate to severe pains. Addiction to the drug is not likely when the drug is used according to the doctor’s prescription. Although the drug is not always addictive, some cases of addiction have been reported. Below are some of the signs and symptoms of <strong>Tramal abuse</strong>:  <ul>  	<li>Recurrent inability to complete different obligations</li>  	<li>Constant use in hazardous situations such as driving</li>  	<li>When substance use results in legal problems</li>  	<li>Extended use despite negative results</li>  </ul>  There are also some side effects, both long term and short term, that arise from the wrong use of Tramal.

182,"Triazolam Addiction - Signs, Symptoms and Effects",triazolam-addiction-signs-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/02,"Triazolam is a type of medicine used on a short-term basis to treat insomnia, such as difficulty in falling and staying asleep. It is a benzodiazepine drug, which is similar to Valium. The medicine works by slowing the activity of the brain to allow the patient to sleep. It depresses the central nervous system, which causes drowsiness, resulting in falling asleep. It should only be used for no more than 2 to 3 weeks, according to doctor’s prescription.    Triazolam should be taken before bedtime or after dinner but not immediately. It comes in the form of a tablet, which users should take by mouth. After taking the medicine, you will soon become sleepy and will remain sleepy for a long period until you fall asleep. So after you have taken the drug, make sure to go to bed. If not, you will probably feel sleepy throughout the day.    The medicine can be taken upon the prescription of a doctor. It should also be used on a short period of time. Constantly using it for several weeks may cause some problems. Normally, the medicine will help you fall asleep better after a week or two but not more than that.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Triazolam Addiction</h2>  Triazolam is commonly used to treat insomnia symptoms but is also used for treating other ailments. However, not everyone can take the drug. Before taking Triazolam, you have to consult with your doctor and tell about your health conditions.  <h3>Signs not to take Triazolam:</h3>  <ul>  	<li>History of depression</li>  	<li>History of drug addiction</li>  	<li>History of mental illnesses</li>  	<li>Breathing problems</li>  	<li>Have kidney disease</li>  	<li>Pregnant or planning to get pregnant</li>  	<li>Breastfeeding</li>  </ul>  There are also some symptoms associated with Triazolam. This medicine may cause drowsiness, dizziness, amnesia as well as light-headedness. Patients with history of depression may not be recommended to use the drug because it may cause suicidal tendencies.    If you are pregnant, Triazolam should not be taken, especially when breastfeeding. This drug can cause birth defects to unborn babies and may even cause health hazards from breastfeeding. Do not use it without your doctor’s approval.    You should not also take the medicine when you are drinking alcohol because it can cause serious side effects that may impair your thinking as well as actions. Studies also show that this drug is not suitable to anyone under 18 years old.  <h2>Effects of Abusing Drug (Short and Long Term)</h2>  Triazolam is an effective medication for individuals suffering from insomnia. However, it is usually prescribed for only 1 to 2 weeks. Going beyond that may cause some short as well as long term side effects. In such cases, patients may experience withdrawal reactions, such as nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, flushing, as well as nervousness. If you experience these, stop using the medication. In order to prevent withdrawal effects, your doctor could probably ask you to lower your dosage.  Using Triazolam for a long period may also cause ineffectiveness. Therefore, if it is not working anymore, consult your doctor and ask for medical guidance.    The medicine may rarely cause addiction. There are a few patients who have taken the drug and have been seen with abnormal drug seeking behavior. If you have a history of alcohol or drug addiction, your dependency on this drug may be increased. So take this medication only as prescribed by your doctor to lessen the chances of addiction.    Some effects of Triazolam may include having trouble sleeping after stopping the medication. It is usually called rebound insomnia. This is absolutely normal. You may experience it only 1 to 2 days. But if the effect still continues, the best thing to do is call your doctor.  <h2>Statistics of Triazolam Addiction</h2>  Although Triazolam has been approved in the United States, statistics of people getting hooked to this is very high. In fact, it has been banned to other countries because of its addictive side effects. Medical surveys also show that 39% of users who has <strong>Triazolam addiction</strong> complained of having disturbing thoughts that often lead to suicidal. What is worse is that these patients have no previous mental health problems.    Statistics also show that people who experienced addiction to this drug stopped ingesting the medicine. But that led to withdrawal symptoms, which came out quickly than expected. Ideally, doctors would monitor the patient and would lessen the dosage for treatment."
185,"Tussionex Addiction - Signs, Symptoms and Effects",tussionex-addiction-signs-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/02,"When it comes to prescription drugs, one can never be too careful. They can be just as harmful as any other type of drug especially if they are not used as directed. This is the case for even some of the cough medicine like Tussionex; hence, it is imperative to use caution with all medicine. As much as treating a cough may sound like an easy thing, here is an overview of one of the prescriptions of cough suspension for better understanding.    The history of Tussionex is as deep as the history of hydrocodones go. This is primarily because, the hydrocodones are part of the active ingredients that are found in this cough treating medication. The other active ingredient in Tussionex is chlorpheniramine. Hydrocodone has its roots deeply embedded in two other naturally occurring opiates which are known as cobein and thebaine. Coupled with a paracetamol like acetaminophen, hydrocodone is able to form a great painkilling tag team.    As mentioned earlier, Tussionex is a combination of two active ingredients. Hydrocodone and chlorpheniramine. On one hand, Hydrocodone is a narcotic cough suppressant that works on the brain’s cough center and helps to cut down the urge to cough. Chlorpheniramine on the other hand is an antihistamine. It works by reducing the levels of a chemical that occurs naturally in the body called histamine which is responsible for watery eyes, itching and a running nose. With that said, now you can see why these two drugs are the core of Tussionex. Simply put, Tussionex is used in the treatment of the common cold.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Tussionex Addiction</h2>  While Tussionex maybe an effective relief for those that are suffering from the common cold, it does not come without its fair share of allergies and side effects. For those that might be allergic to the drug, the symptoms include swelling which occurs in the face, the throat, lips and the tongue. If any of the allergy symptoms are noticed, one is advised to visit a doctor as soon as possible.    While most people might not be allergic to Tussionex, sudden interruption of the medication can cause some withdrawal effects and hepatic damage as is the case when it comes to withdrawal from high paracetamol dosages. The withdrawal effects and symptoms may vary and more so in seriousness but some of the most serious would include tightness of the chest, shallow and/or weak breathing, hallucinations and confusion, pain while urinating or having to urinate less than usual or not at all in which case you should also ensure that you see a doctor if any of these signs manifest. The minor side effects include dizziness, blurred vision, dry mouth among others. It is worth noting that because of the adverse effects and impacts that this drug has on the normal functioning of the brain, it is not advisable for one to drive after they have taken Tussionex. It is also not advisable for expectant and nursing mothers as well as alcoholics to take the drug.  <h2>Effects of Abusing Tussionex</h2>  <strong>Tussionex addiction</strong> is as hard to quit as any other street drug that is on the market. The impacts of abusing this particular drug are so risky to one’s health that the FDA even issued a warning on the same back in 2008 and given the effects, one has no option but to agree with them.    If you don’t believe it, here are some of the effects other that one would suffer from for taking more than the prescribed dosage of Tussionex. Cardiac arrest, lack of oxygen resulting in a blue skin, breathing difficulties, low blood pressure, slow heartbeat, fatigue resulting to extreme sleepiness, stupor and at times a coma, temporal breathing cessation and muscle flabbiness. Given these effects, you see why this drug should be only a drug of last result and should be used only in extreme circumstances.  <h2>The Statistics of Tussionex</h2>  It is said that numbers do not lie. This is more so the case after one has had a look at the figures that are coming up as a result of people using Tussionex or one of its active ingredients. For instance, 20% of the people that take a prescription that contains hydrocodone end up becoming dependent or addicted to the drug with teens making up 65% of the people that get addicted to the same compound. The damning part is that any one at any age group can be addicted to hydrocodone which puts more emphasis on ensuring that one only takes this medication when they really need to and given that since the 90’s the number of Tussionex prescriptions falling in the wrong hands has soared to well over 11 million, one can safely say that it is the primary source of hydrocodone."
187,"Tylox Addiction - Signs, Symptoms and Effects",tylox-addiction-signs-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/02,"Tylox is one of the most effective medicines used as tranquilizers. It is used to relieve moderately severe pain. The drug is composed of oxycodone (14-hydroxydihydrocodeinone, odorless white powder) and acetaminophen (white and odorless crystalline powder having a bitter taste) which work interdependently to reduce pain. A single capsule of Tylox contains 5mg of Oxycodone Hydrochloride and 500mg of acetaminophen. The inactive ingredients contained in this drug include titanium dioxide, gelatin, magnesium stearate, corn starch etc. Oxycodone is a narcotic pain reliever which is always derived from the thebaine, an opium alkaloid. Acetaminophen boosts the functionality and makes oxycodone more effective.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Tylox Addiction</h2>  This drug works in your spinal cord and the brain (the central nervous system). Tylox affects how your body responds to pain by blocking the factors inside the body which are responsible for the fever or pain. People who are showing signs of pain or fever may use Tylox. There are various signs and symptoms associated with oxycodone abuse.    Some common signs and symptoms of <strong>Tylox addictio</strong>n include:  <ul>  	<li>Frequently thinking about Tylox</li>  	<li>Hiding the drug</li>  	<li>Using the drug in secret</li>  	<li>Obtaining multiple prescriptions</li>  	<li>Phantom pains when the drug isn’t available</li>  	<li>Restless thoughts</li>  </ul>  When people try to cut down the use of this drug due to addiction, they may experience certain severe withdrawal symptoms. Some of the early signs of the withdrawal symptoms are horrendous and include anorexia, dilated pupils, stomach cramps, nausea, hypertension and even sweating. It is usually difficult for addicts of this drug to wean themselves off from its addiction. It usually takes the intervention of a doctor or a rehab program for an addict to completely get rid of the drug.  <h2>Effects of Abusing Tylox</h2>  A drug is always said to be abused if used in ways not prescribed by the medical practitioner. You have to keep in mind not to use this drug if you recently used tranquilizers, sedatives, alcohol or any other narcotic medication. Also, if you’ve taken an MAO inhibitor in the past two weeks, you must avoid using this medicine because of drug interaction which may be fatal if it occurs. Some of the common MAO inhibitors include tranylcypromine, rasagiline, isocarboxazid, phenelzine and linezolid.    To avoid abusing this drug, don’t take more or less than is recommended. You should note that an excess of acetaminophen can completely destroy your liver and sometimes it can cause death. After using this drug, call your doctor if you develop pain in your upper stomach, itching, jaundice, and nausea, lack of appetite, colored stools or even dark urine. In rare occasions, taking this drug can cause skin reaction. If your skin suddenly develops acne or rash that causes blistering and peeling that spreads quickly, conduct your doctor right away.    Since this is a narcotic medicine, it has the potential of causing addiction. Therefore, be careful when using the drug because of its habit forming nature. Also, avoid sharing the drug with a person having history of drug abuse.    Some of the most serious side effects of Tylox include:  <ul>  	<li>Slow heartbeat and consequently slow breathing.</li>  	<li>Passing out several times a day</li>  	<li>Confusion and development of weird behavior</li>  	<li>Convulsions (seizure)</li>  	<li>Jaundice and nausea</li>  </ul>  Some side effects are uncommon and mild. They include:  <ul>  	<li>Stomach upsets</li>  	<li>Mild nausea</li>  	<li>Dry mouth</li>  	<li>Vomiting</li>  	<li>Blurred vision</li>  </ul>  <h2>Tylox Statistics</h2>  Recent research findings from Medline Plus indicate that about 9% of Americans abuse opiates each year. And in fact, oxycodone is one of the most abused opiates. The findings include both those patients who bought the drug on the street and those who bought it under doctor’s prescription.    In addition, the US Department of Justice found that about 13 million Americans use oxycodone for recreational purposes. It is said that the rate of abuse of Tylox is 40% higher than in the previous generations. It is now considered as the second most abused drug after bhang. Statistics show that there has been over 500% increase in the number patients who are seeking treatment due to this drug’s addiction while there has been a 129% increase of people visiting the emergency department.    In 2004, a report by National Survey on Drug Use and Health indicated that over 3 million people over the age of 11 had tried this drug for recreational purposes. Out of the 40 million prescriptions that were administered in US in 2012, 19% were for oxycodone.    Tylox is an effective pain reliever drug which many people have abused its purpose. Remember that the drug is a narcotic and it just affects your body organs and systems as any other narcotic substance when used in excess or without doctor’s prescription."
189,"Ultram Addiction - Signs, Symptoms and Effects",ultram-addiction-signs-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/02,"Ultram is a kind of narcotic-like pain reliever that is usually prescribed to treat sciatica, neck pain, lower back pain and other related conditions as it acts in the brain centrally to modulate pain sensation. It is also known as tramadol and was approved in 1998 by the FDA. It has a solid scientific background that allows the substance to assist millions of people all over the world.    The drug’s potent molecule was first developed on 1977 by Grunenthal a German pharmaceutical giant. It has since been marketed using various genetic band names such as Ultracet, Conzip, Ryolt, Zytram XL and Ralivia. Over the years the drug has been changed and also marketed by a number of companies operating under Grunenthal license to offer patients better and faster pain relief. It was initially developed as a replacement for the narcotic painkillers that were in the market. However physicians and patients have reported cases of high dependency on the drug. This has created controversy, one of the reasons why it has not been scheduled as controlled substances in some areas because it was specifically manufactured to offer low level of dependency and a person can rarely get hooked within the first 3 months. But when it is used for a long time or abused dependency may develop.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Ultram Addiction</h2>  There are a number of signs and symptoms that could affect people who abuse Ultram. Most of them can be easily recognized as:  <ul>  	<li>Skin rash</li>  	<li>Itching</li>  	<li>Reduced body temperatures</li>  	<li>Severe vomiting</li>  	<li>Shaking</li>  	<li>Hallucinations</li>  	<li>Reduced blood pressure</li>  	<li>Nausea</li>  	<li>Constipation</li>  	<li>Headaches</li>  	<li>Clammy skin</li>  	<li>Cold skin</li>  	<li>Somnolence</li>  	<li>Flaccid muscles</li>  	<li>Slowed breathing/difficulty breathing</li>  	<li>Pinpoint pupils</li>  	<li>Slowed heart rate</li>  	<li>Dizziness</li>  	<li>Drowsiness</li>  	<li>Deep sleep</li>  	<li>Lightheadedness</li>  	<li>Unconsciousness or fainting</li>  </ul>  <h2>Effects of Abusing Drug (Short and Long Term)</h2>  A person who suffered short term of <strong>Ultram addiction</strong> may have:  <ul>  	<li>Decreased or abnormal touch sensation</li>  	<li>Stomach or abdominal fullness</li>  	<li>Stomach pain</li>  	<li>Indigestion</li>  	<li>Bloating</li>  	<li>Blisters under the skin</li>  	<li>Blood in urine</li>  	<li>Difficulties when urinating</li>  	<li>Darkened urine</li>  	<li>Frequent urge to urinate</li>  	<li>Change in balance and walking</li>  	<li>Lightheadedness or dizziness especially when getting up from a sitting or lying position</li>  	<li>Fast heartbeat</li>  	<li>Irregular heartbeat</li>  	<li>Fainting</li>  	<li>Discomfort or chest pains</li>  	<li>Chills</li>  	<li>Numbness and tingling of the toes, fingers and face</li>  	<li>Weakness in the feet or hands</li>  	<li>Pain in arms and legs</li>  	<li>Recurrent fever</li>  	<li>Severe cramping</li>  	<li>Sweats</li>  	<li>Shaking and trembling of the feet and hands</li>  	<li>Weak or even absent pulses in the legs</li>  	<li>Yellow skin or eyes</li>  	<li>Unusual tiredness/ yawning all the time</li>  	<li>Increased sweating</li>  </ul>  <h3>Long term Ultram Addiction include:</h3>  <ul>  	<li>Increased blood pressure</li>  	<li>Blurred vision</li>  	<li>Seizures/convulsions</li>  	<li>Loss of memory</li>  	<li>Severe nausea</li>  	<li>Severe swelling, redness and itching of the skin</li>  	<li>Seeing, hearing or feeling things that are not actually there</li>  </ul>  <h2>Statistics of Drug</h2>  For a very long time, medical professionals had thought Ultram safe because they considered its effects as a narcotic quite weak, implying that it would not result in addiction and abuse. Statistics however reveal that there are very many cases which have been reported about individuals getting addicted to the drug. The fact is the drug has higher potential of abuse than doctors had thought. The Food and Drug administration reports that at between the years of 1995 and 2004, there were around 766 cases of abuse of the drug and about 482 cases recorded for withdrawal symptoms. It also adds that the numbers could be higher because there are also very many cases that normally go unreported. Addiction is usually high with individuals who have history of suffering from chronic pain. Health professionals and people who have had problems with alcohol and illegal drugs are also at risk mainly because of the working and composition established that is the same as morphine.    A common misconception is that almost all prescription drugs are safe to use especially for recreation because they are not illegal. People who abuse these drugs do not know that if they are not used for specific medical conditions, they can end up doing more harm than good and that they should only be used under direction of physician. It is also important to note that Ultram should not be used if you are using sedatives, alcohol, narcotic medication or sedatives within a few hours. It should also not be taken in larger amounts or longer than prescribed."
191,"Valium Abuse - Signs, Symptoms and Effects",valium-abuse-signs-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/02,"Valium is the trade name given to a tranquillizer drug introduced by pharmaceutical company Hoffmann-La Roche in the year 1963. Safer and a more effective sedative-hypnotic drug, Valium became the standard drug for treating anxiety. It also became one of the most commonly prescribed medicines of the time. Throughout the history of prescribed medication, Valium was the very first billion dollar medicine. It was also one of the first drugs with a brand name. It was believed that Valium wasn't addictive; however, after about ten years in the market, it had been prescribed to around 59.3 million people. By the year 1975, Valium was being sold and used in the streets as an illegal drug. Although it was considered generally safe, reports of dependency and withdrawal started coming forward.    Valium is prescribed to treat withdrawal symptoms, treat anxiety disorders and treat muscle spasms. It works by replacing chemicals produced in the brain and slowing down any abnormal fast electrical activity. This substance creates feelings of relaxation and this is one of the reasons it addictive. Prolonged use of Valium causes one to develop a tolerance. So what are the signs and symptoms of Valium addiction?  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Valium Abuse</h2>  There are a number of symptoms that arise from <strong>Valium abuse</strong>. They include but are not limited to:  <ul>  	<li>Depression</li>  	<li>Confusion</li>  	<li>Aggression</li>  	<li>Change in eating behaviors</li>  	<li>Slowed movements</li>  	<li>Change in personal hygiene</li>  	<li>Irritability</li>  	<li>Slower reaction times</li>  	<li>Drowsiness</li>  	<li>Spinning sensations</li>  	<li>Nausea</li>  	<li>Dizziness</li>  	<li>Restlessness</li>  	<li>Muscle weakness</li>  	<li>Amnesia</li>  	<li>Poor judgment</li>  	<li>Memory loss</li>  	<li>Hallucinations</li>  	<li>Skin rash or itching</li>  	<li>Loss of inhibitions</li>  	<li>Short Term Side Effects of abusing Valium</li>  </ul>  The short term effects of Valium are felt fast when the drug is misused. The drug decreases brain activity including the way messages in the brain are transmitted. This results into uncoordinated sensations. When the drug is at its peak, the user gets a rush of good feelings. The coordination and euphoric problems could give a user a drunken feeling. However, with continued use, the body builds a tolerance quickly and makes it harder for a user to reach the euphoric state. Over time an increased amount of the drug is needed.  <h2>Long Term Side Effects</h2>  An extended use of Valium can have very powerful effects on the body and the brain. These effects could be permanent and life threatening. Long term effects of Valium include:  <ul>  	<li>Sleep disturbances and insomnia</li>  	<li>Urinary retention</li>  	<li>Changes in libido</li>  	<li>Changes in salivation including hyper-salivation and dry mouth</li>  	<li>Incontinence</li>  	<li>Slower pulse</li>  	<li>Coma.</li>  	<li>Heart attack</li>  	<li>Puffy swollen face</li>  	<li>Breathing difficulties.</li>  	<li>Social Isolation</li>  	<li>Financial difficulties</li>  	<li>Job loss</li>  	<li>Mentally and physically dependent on the drug with severe withdrawal symptoms when one does not have enough in the system</li>  	<li>Vertigo</li>  	<li>Aggressive and violent behavior</li>  	<li>Mood swings</li>  	<li>Inability to perform tasks</li>  	<li>Incarceration and other legal problems</li>  	<li>Family and marital issues</li>  	<li>Death in the case of an overdose</li>  	<li>Paradoxical Effects</li>  </ul>  A paradoxical effect is an effect that should be eliminated by the consumption of a drug but instead shows up stronger when the drug is consumed. With Valium, paradoxical effects include aggression, excitement, irritability, hostility, fits of rage, and violence. A user may lose control of his or her impulses which leads to an anti-social behavior. Other people may consider committing suicide while other become emotionally blunted.    Some people take Valium to fall asleep, but continued use for this reason for a few months makes it lose its effects. One of the worst effects of Valium is when it is combined with opiates or alcohol, it can be fatal. As tolerance builds to Valium and a person does not get the desired high, they could add alcohol to achieve the effect. If you are in search of the effects of this drug abuse on a person, look out for a weak and rapid pulse, dilated pupils, clammy skin and shallow breathing. A driver who is addicted to Valium is more likely to wander in his lanes on the road and have slower reaction times.  <h2>Statistics of Valium Addiction</h2>  Although the most used drug in America is marijuana, doctors have reported more than sixty million prescriptions for tranquillizers and sedatives including Valium. The Drug Abuse Network wrote that 229,230 emergency room visits in the year 2009 were related to sedatives like Valium in combination with alcohol. CDC reports prescription painkillers that include Valium are the cause of over 36,000 fatal overdoses each year. This number exceeds the number of deaths that are caused by cocaine and heroine overdoses."
194,"Vicodin Addiction - Signs, Symptoms and Effects",vicodin-addiction-signs-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/02,"The drug Vicodin is a combination of acetaminophen and hydrocodone – an opiate that physicians often prescribe for the relief of moderate to severe pain. The drug works by blocking the pain receptors of the brain and inducing a sense of euphoria. This makes the drug highly effective but also extremely addictive. Drug misuse and dependence develops gradually and before you know it, you are struggling with Vicodin abuse and addiction.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Vicodin Addiction</h2>  Persons who take the drug become relaxed and experience euphoria, and any physical pain starts to decrease. With time, users become tolerant of the drug and they need more and more of the drug in order to achieve the same results. Most of the people who abuse Vicodin take 20 to 30 pills of the drug each day. Some users take more than this.    The following are the most notable signs and symptoms of <strong>Vicodin addiction</strong>:  <ul>  	<li>Intense obsession with buying and consuming Vicodin</li>  	<li>Inability to focus on a given chore, extreme anxiety and paranoia, nausea and vomiting, severe mood swings, appearing drowsy</li>  </ul>  People who abuse Vicodin often resort to fraudulent means for example doctor shopping to obtain more of the drug. Due to their obsession with buying and consuming the drug, every other aspect of their lives takes a back seat. Their personal, financial and professional conditions begin to unravel.  <h2>Effects of Vicodin Abuse</h2>  It does not take a lot to experience the effects of using Vicodin. Even casual users or persons who closely follow a prescription dose can experience:  <ul>  	<li>Itching, Dizziness, Stomach upset Swelling, Vomiting and Weakness</li>  	<li>Prolonged drug use can lead to medical problems including jaundice, liver damage or liver failure and urinary tract problems</li>  </ul>  Because Vicodin is a depressant of the central nervous system, an overdose of the drug naturally decreases the heart rate and respiration. An overdose occurs when a person takes a large dose or combines a Vicodin dose with another kind of central nervous system depressant, like alcohol, barbiturate or another opiate.    The most common problem with Vicodin is the withdrawal symptoms that can set in if the dose is reduced or when there is a light delay between one dose and another. This is one of the greatest challenges during recovery.  <h2>Vicodin Abuse Treatment</h2>  There are many options when you seek treatment for your Vicodin problems. You should first decide whether you will enter an outpatient or an inpatient rehab program. For severe addiction, the best solution is an inpatient rehabilitation program. If you have a reliable support network of family and friends at home, you can settle for an outpatient program. Whether you select an outpatient or an inpatient program, you may also decide to go through the process with a licensed medical expert. This reduces the amount of pain you will go through.    After you have settled on a particular rehab program, you then decide for how long you will stay on the rehab. Most physicians and researchers recommend a minimum of one month stay in a rehab program. A counselor will help you while making these important decisions.  <h3>Most Vicodin treatment programs follow a standard approach which includes:</h3>  <ul>  	<li>A comprehensive intake process of assessing your general medical and mental condition</li>  	<li>Properly supervised detoxification</li>  	<li>Individual and group therapy with or with no support groups</li>  	<li>A thorough aftercare program.</li>  </ul>  The aftercare program will usually include continued treatment in an individual or group setting as well as participation in support groups. The aftercare program also addresses financial, legal, medical or professional issues which may have resulted because of your Vicodin abuse. This is the start of recovery.  <h2>Vicodin Statistics</h2>  Below are facts and statistics of Vicodin abuse in the USA.    i) Hydrocodone is the most widely prescribed opiate (http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drugs_concern/hydrocodone.pdf) in the United States with over 139 million prescriptions filled in 2010 alone.  ii) The most frequent prescribed prescriptions with hydrocone are those which combine the opiate with acetaminophen and under the brand names Lortab or Vicodin.  iii) The American Association of Poison Control Centers reported over 27000 exposures and over 30 deaths due to products containing hydrocone in 2009 (http://www.researchgate.net/publication/49715957_2009_Annual_Report_of_the_American_Association_of_Poison_Control_Centers%27_National_Poison_Data_System_%28NPDS%29_27th_Annual_Report) .  iv) The 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health reported that over 23 million adults and children aged 12 years and above had abused some kind of hydrocodone at least once in their lives (http://samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k9NSDUH/2k9Results.htm)."
196,"Vicoprofen Abuse - Signs, Symptoms and Effects",vicoprofen-abuse-signs-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/02,"Vicoprofen is a combination of hydrocodone and ibuprofen. It is supplied in a combination tablet-form for oral administration. Vicoprofen combines the opioid analgesic agent - hydrocodone with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent - ibuprofen.    Vicoprofen is widely used for the short-term relief from acute pain. Being a medicine made with two pain relieving drugs, Vicoprofen is regarded as one of the most powerful analgesic drug. While Hydrocodone is a narcotic analgesic, ibuprofen is an NSAID which reduces inflammation, pain and fever.    The hydrocodone present in Vicoprofen can cause psychological and physical dependence when used for a very long time. It is advised to use the drug only under medical supervision to prevent the chances of addiction. Users should avoid taking this drug without prescription as it also increases the risk of breathing disorders. Vicoprofen can also increase the chance of heart attack that can even lead to death. It may cause bleeding and ulcers in the stomach during treatment.    Hydrocodone, as an active ingredient in Vicoprofen, is widely abused by patients for the opiate-like effect it offers. People who find relief from pain after using this drug have a great tendency to abuse it at the later stage.    Hydrocodone gives equivalent effect like any other opiate drug, particularly Morphine. Apart from helping to relieve symptoms of pain, it can even lead to a number of health complications, when abused for a long time. This is applicable for Vicoprofen as well. With ibuprofen used in combination, the negative effect of <strong>Vicoprofen abuse</strong> tend to increase, leading to havoc repercussions. Just like other opiates, the adverse effects of Vicoprofen abuse or dependence, is something becoming a greater concern.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Vicoprofen Addiction</h2>  Addiction to Vicoprofen can cause a greater number of changes in an individual’s life. Taking this medication without prescription, or abusing it for a long time can lead to a number of psychological, physical and behavioral symptoms. However, signs and symptoms of <strong>Vicoprofen abuse</strong> can vary from a person to person. So, it may not be easy to spot them, especially if the person is aware of his addiction and know how to hide the signs well. In most cases, short term users become tolerant to the side effects of the drug abuse, which encourage them to depend more on it for their needs. Despite of all this, there are a few common symptoms that one must look for in an individual to find out whether he or she is already addicted to the opiate. These symptoms are:  <h3>Psychological symptoms:</h3>  <ul>  	<li>Worsening of mental health</li>  	<li>Psychosis</li>  	<li>Hallucinations</li>  	<li>Delusions</li>  	<li>Decreased memory</li>  	<li>Increased mental illness</li>  	<li>Lack of emotions</li>  </ul>  <h3>Behavioral symptoms:</h3>  <ul>  	<li>Requesting frequent refills of the drug</li>  	<li>Seeing multiple doctors to get extra prescriptions</li>  	<li>Spending time alone, away from closed ones</li>  	<li>Going through financial problems</li>  	<li>Focusing more on getting high at all times</li>  	<li>Sudden changes in social activities</li>  	<li>Disinterest in work and responsibilities</li>  </ul>  <h3>Physical symptoms:</h3>  <ul>  	<li>Blue tinges on lips</li>  	<li>Seizures</li>  	<li>Respiratory depression</li>  	<li>Dizziness</li>  	<li>Low blood pressure</li>  	<li>Rashes</li>  	<li>Fainting</li>  	<li>Itching</li>  	<li>Dry mouth</li>  	<li>Constipation</li>  	<li>Decreased sex drive</li>  	<li>Urinary retention</li>  </ul>  <h3>Mood Symptoms:</h3>  <ul>  	<li>Depression</li>  	<li>Sense of well being</li>  	<li>Anxiety</li>  	<li>Calmness</li>  	<li>Euphoria</li>  	<li>Emotional numbing</li>  	<li>Mood swings</li>  </ul>  <h2>Effects of Abusing Vicoprofen (Short and Long Term)</h2>  When taken according to the prescription, Vicoprofen can offer effective relief from pain, but can take the form of addiction when used for a prolonged period of time. In the long term, the body of the user changes the way the drug should be processed.    Addiction to Vicoprofen can cause several short and long term health consequences, having severe impact on the physical, social and psychological stature of a person. Here are some effects that one can see in an abuser:  <h3>Physical effects:</h3>  <ul>  	<li>Abnormally Low Blood Pressure</li>  	<li>Drowsiness Less Severe</li>  	<li>Inducing of a Relaxed Easy State</li>  	<li>Feeling Faint</li>  	<li>Dizzy</li>  	<li>Feel Like</li>  	<li>Throwing Up</li>  	<li>Heartburn</li>  	<li>Stomach Cramps</li>  	<li>Feeling Weak</li>  	<li>Slow Heartbeat</li>  	<li>Vocal Cord Swelling</li>  	<li>Collapsed Portion of Lung</li>  	<li>Significant Decrease in Lung Function</li>  	<li>Bronchospasm</li>  	<li>Visible Water Retention</li>  	<li>Fast Heartbeat</li>  	<li>Change in Pulse</li>  	<li>Trouble Breathing</li>  	<li>Abnormal Nervous System Function Affecting Mental Alertness</li>  	<li>Giant Hives</li>  	<li>Water Retention</li>  	<li>Double Vision</li>  	<li>Blurred Vision</li>  </ul>  <h3>Psychological effects:</h3>  <ul>  	<li>Confused</li>  	<li>Low self-esteem</li>  	<li>Increased anxiety</li>  	<li>Depression</li>  	<li>Feelings of anger</li>  	<li>Rage</li>  	<li>Mood swings</li>  	<li>Negative body image</li>  	<li>Altered perceptions</li>  	<li>Personality shifts</li>  	<li>Paranoia</li>  </ul>  <h2>Statistics of Vicoprofen Abuse</h2>  Vicoprofen is one those drugs that contain high concentration of Hydrocodone. <strong>Vicoprofen abuse</strong> can thus, lead to high degree of addiction and needs rehab as the immediate withdrawal can be pretty nasty for the user. According to statistics, there has been 30% increase in the total cases of Vicoprofen addiction between the years 2006 and 2010.    In 2009, more than 50 million prescriptions were made for Vicoprofen and about 3 million cases were registered in the ER for its addiction, in the same year."
198,"Vivitrol Abuse - Signs, Symptoms and Effects",vivitrol-abuse-signs-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/02,"Vivitrol is a medication that is prescribed to help treat people who have addictions to alcohol or opiates. It is a slow release formulation of the treatment known as Naltrexone that is also marketed under the names Depade and Nevia. The way in which Vivitrol is intended to be taken is through the preparation and injection of a solution. The Vivitrol is injected into a muscle. This usually occurs once every four weeks but this can alter in some rare circumstances.    The way in which Vivitrol works is by acting as a opioid receptor antagonist. The effect this has on a person is to block the effects of alcohol or opiates such as heroin when they are consumed. This has the intended purpose of stopping a person pursuing their substance abuse and the harmful effects that accompany it. The medicine is used to both help people initially break their addictive behaviors and to prevent a relapse once sobriety has been achieved.    Vivitrol was first approved for the treatment of alcohol addiction in 2006 which was followed by its official approval for use in opiate addiction treatment in 2010. The decision to grant approval for Vivitrol's use in treating opiate addiction followed months of careful clinical trials and observations. The drug was shown to be far more beneficial than a placebo and free of many of the side effects which accompany other forms of treatment. There are still risks to Vivitrol, however, and it has its own range of side effects to be aware of.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Vivitrol Abuse</h2>  There are many misconceptions surrounding the abuse of Vivitrol. Many people wrongly assume that it is not possible to abuse either Naltrexone or Vivitrol due to the fact that they are not opiates and are not physically addictive. This is wrong. Due to the fact that Vivitrol is injected there have been instances of heroin addicts getting hold of it and injecting it believing it will provide some type of high. While this is a mistaken belief it is still dangerous as injecting Vivitrol when opiates are still present in the body makes the risk of serious side effects occurring increase.    Aside from addicts who believe that using Vivitrol will get them high, many addicts attempt to illicitly use Vivitrol as a method of breaking free of their original addiction. This is incredibly dangerous as attempting to inject a substance into a muscle without correct medical training can lead to complications. Abusers of Vivitrol may also find it hard to ensure they are receiving a precise dosage of the substance. Vivitrol can have severe effects when taken at doses exceeding the safe maximum.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Vivitrol Addiction</h2>  There are very severe risks to abusing Vivitrol or to taking it in conjunction with alcohol or street drugs. This is one of the primary ways in which the substance is abused. If Vivitrol is taken in conjunction with street drugs or even alcohol there are instances where it can cause a person to slip into a coma or even die.    Vivitrol also has an effect on the liver and is therefore a dangerous choice for anyone who has preexisting liver problems. One of the effects of abusing Vivitrol, particularly at high doses, is the risk it poses to healthy liver functioning. If a high dose of Vivitrol is taken in an abusive way and the person taking it has poor liver functioning already then their skin may become jaundiced. This is an indicator that the person may be abusing Vivitrol.    Due to the fact that <strong>Vivitrol abuse</strong> often results in an unsafe dosage of the drug being taken in an improper way it greatly increases the risk of allergic reactions or side effects occurring. These can include blurry and unfocused vision as well as other sight issues. Skin problems such as hard, unyielding skin lumps around the site of injection can also indicate the body is reacting badly to the presence of Vivitrol.  <h2>Vivitrol Statistics</h2>  Vivitrol use has been clinically studied in over 1000 people from different backgrounds. It is believed that around 50,000 people have been treated with Vivitrol. It is unknown how many of these people abused it and how many who were not prescribed it have obtained it to use illicitly. Vivitrol has been shown to have a significantly positive effect on the likelihood of patients to attend psychosocial therapy as opposed to other forms of treatment. Naltrexone, on which Vivitrol is based, has been used successfully for over three decades."

Xanax can become quite addictive, especially if it is taken in larger quantities, or if it is being used for a longer period of time. Even users who take it as a prescribed medication by their doctors can become severely addicted to Xanax.  <h2>History of Xanax</h2>  Alprazolam was firstly synthesized by Upjohn Company back in 1960s, and it was created in hopes to create a great sleeping aid that would feature muscle relaxant qualities. It was only in later 1960s when Dr. David Sheehan realized that main effectiveness of their drug is to treat panic, mood and most importantly anxiety disorders. It has been officially released to American drug market in 1981. All of the Alprazolam drugs (including Xanax) are right now classified as VI Schedule narcotics within USA.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Xanax Addiction</h2>  Severe Xanax abuse can have various signs and symptoms which could be classified as highly negative.

Some people may even develop severe memory impairment that will typically only affect someone's short term memory. People that are taking higher doses of Xanax may experience sedation which can last up to 4 days.    Short term abuse of Xanax however will most probably not have many negative consequences and effects on Xanax user, especially if Xanax has been prescribed to you by your doctor.  <h2>Statistics of Xanax</h2>  <strong>Xanax addiction</strong> has become a very widespread problem all across the world, and it has already negatively affected lives of high number of adults. Since addiction for Xanax can develop over certain period of time, it may also take some time before you can even realize that you are experiencing problem with Xanax.

Hydrocodone is an opioid pain reliever. An opioid is sometimes referred to as a narcotic. Acetaminophen is not as potent as hydrocodone, but it is still a pain killer. It is combined with hydrocodone to boost the effectiveness of the latter. When combined, these two ingredients give forth an effective pain reliever, Xodol, which is used for moderate to severe pain. Usually, Xodol is prescribed for short term pain relief. Since it is made from a narcotic ingredient, Xodol is classified as a controlled substance. As such there are strict rules regulating its sale and use. Xodol is sold in tablet form and is commonly taken every four to six hours, or as per the physician's orders.  <h2>How Xodol Works</h2>  As already mentioned, Xodol contains two active ingredients. Hydrocodone is a semi-synthetic opioid which is similar to codeine. Hydrocodone is very effective at relieving pain. In the US, it is available only in combination with other medication. It is not available as a pure medication on its own. The other ingredient is acetaminophen, which is found in common drugs such as Tylenol. Acetaminophen is a pain reliever and a fever reducer. Compared to other drugs which combine the two ingredients, Xodol contains less acetaminophen.  <h2>Xodol and Substance Abuse</h2>  As is the case with many prescription drugs, Xodol is commonly abused by many people in the US and beyond. Misuse and abuse of Xodol is very dangerous. Too much acetaminophen will cause liver failure and possibly lead to death. There are several signs that you can look out for if you are worried that someone close to you is addicted to Xodol.  <h3>Signs and Symptoms of Xodol Abuse:</h3>  1. Use of the medication outside of its recommended purpose. It is one thing to require Xodol for pain relief and it is another to become dependent on it. If you or your loved one requires Xodol for therapeutic or recreational purposes even when there is no pain involved that is a sure sign of abuse.    2. Tampering with the medication with the intention of ensuring rapid release of hydrocodone is another sign of abuse. Remember that hydrocodone is a narcotic and therefore potentially habit forming. Chewing, breaking or crushing the Xodol tablet are signs that you may be getting addicted to the hydrocodone.    3. If you find yourself falsifying Xodol prescriptions, it is time to seek help. Usually drug abusers will go to great lengths to obtain their substance of addiction. Doctor shopping and bogus call-ins for refills are signs that you are addicted to Xodol and need to stop abusing it.  <h3>Effects of Abusing Xodol:</h3>  Besides developing a dependence that may be crippling, <strong>Xodol abuse</strong> means that you are ingesting large amounts of acetaminophen and hydrocodone. These have a significant effect on your organs, with acetaminophen being known to cause liver failure. If severe, liver failure can result in death. Abuse will also lead to nausea, constipation, dizziness and even vomiting. You will not be able to carry on with your life as normal.    <strong>Xodol abuse</strong> also means dedicating large amounts of money, time and energy towards obtaining your substance of addiction. This leads to financial strife, especially where you have dependents.  <h2>Xodol Statistics</h2>  According to statistics dating back to 2010, 1 out of 20 Americans use prescription drugs for non-medicinal purposes. Categorized as Schedule II by the USA Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), Xodol is one of those prescription medications that are commonly abused by Americans. On a national level, there were 1.9 million American abusers of prescription drugs as of 2010. The most commonly abused prescription drugs are painkillers, antidepressants and antibiotics.    The reason why prescription drugs like Xodol are so easy to abuse could be explained by the fact that they are readily available in the homes of most Americans. Speaking in terms of statistics, 7 out of 10 Americans take a prescription drugs. This means that at any given time, 7 out of 10 Americans are highly susceptible to drug abuse.    If you think you or your loved one are addicted to Xodol, the wise thing to do is to <a title=""How to Help a Loved One"" href=""http://substanceabuserehabs.com/how-to/how-to-help-a-loved-one/"">seek professional help</a> immediately. Drug addiction can ruin your life as it takes control from you and sends you down a path of destruction. Do not feel ashamed to seek for help. It takes a lot of courage to do so."
204,"Zolpidem Addiction - Signs, Symptoms and Effects",zolpidem-addiction-signs-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/02,"Zolpidem (brand names Stilnox, Ambien, Ambien CR, Intermezzo, Stilnoct, Sublinox, Hypnogen and Zolsana) is a prescription drug used for treating some brain disorders and sleeplessness. It's a short-acting nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic of the imidazopyridine class that potentiates GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, by binding to GABAA receptors at exactly the same place as benzodiazepines. It has a brief half life of two to three hours, and works rapidly, typically within a quarter hour.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Zolpidem Addiction</h2>  Zolpidem hasn't sufficiently demonstrated effectiveness in keeping sleep, unless delivered in a managed-release (CR) form. Nevertheless, it's successful in beginning sleep. Its hypnotic effects are molecularly different from the classical benzodiazepine molecule and is classified as an imidazopyridine, although it is much like those of the benzodiazepine group of drugs. Flumazenil, the benzodiazepine receiver antagonist may also reverse the hypnotic/sedative and memory of zolpidem’s impairing effects.    As a muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant, the effects of the drug aren't apparent until dosages 10 and 20 times those required for sedation are achieved. Because of this, zolpidem has never been approved for seizure prevention or muscle relaxation. Such dramatically increased doses are also more inclined to cause one or more of the adverse side effects of the drug, including amnesia and hallucinations. Contrary to early studies, more recent studies have suggested that zolpidem is actually a powerful anticonvulsant. The anticonvulsant effects aren't recognized until the standard dosage range was surpassed (significance sedation would be a serious side effect), but the threshold for this effect is currently considered to be significantly lower than initial estimates.  <h3>Signs and the Symptoms include:</h3>  <ul>  	<li>Headaches (mainly withdrawal symptom)</li>  	<li>Nausea (mainly withdrawal symptom)</li>  	<li>Vomiting (mainly withdrawal symptom)</li>  	<li>Anterograde amnesia</li>  	<li>Dizziness</li>  	<li>Hallucinations physical perceptions, of changing intensity</li>  	<li>Delusions</li>  	<li>Changed idea routines</li>  	<li>Ataxia or perhaps bad motor coordination, trouble keeping equilibrium</li>  	<li>Euphoria or dysphoria</li>  	<li>Increased desire</li>  	<li>Increased or reduced libido</li>  	<li>Impaired judgment and reasoning</li>  	<li>Uninhibited extroversion in interpersonal or social settings</li>  	<li>Rose impulsivity (mainly withdrawal symptom)</li>  	<li>When ceased, rebound insomnia may happen</li>  </ul>  <h3>Effects of Abusing Drug</h3>  <strong>Driving</strong>  Use of zolpidem may impair driving abilities with a resultant increased risk of road traffic injuries. This adverse effect isn't distinctive to zolpidem but also happens with other hypnotic drugs. Car motorists should exercise care. Studies revealed that eight hours after a bedtime dose of 10 milligrams, 15% of girls and 3% of guys would have blood amounts that generate impaired driving abilities; for an extended-release dose of 12.5 milligrams, the danger increased to 33% and 25%, respectively. As a result, the FDA recommended the dose that prescribers should contemplate lower doses for guys and for girls be reduced.    <strong>Pregnancy</strong>  The FDA has imputed to pregnancy category C zolpidem. Animal studies have been revealed instance of the incomplete ossifications and also increased post implantation fatal loss at doses greater than 7 times the maximum recommended human dose or higher; yet, teratogenicity wasn't found at any dose level. There aren't any restricted data in human pregnancy. Zolpidem in one case report, was seen in cord blood at delivery. Zolpidem is advocated to be used during pregnancy only when benefits outweigh risks.    <strong>Numbers of Drug</strong>  Zolpidem is used to treat sleep problems (insomnia) in adults. Trouble falling asleep can help you fall asleep faster, in order to get a better night's rest, if you have it. Zolpidem belongs to a category of drugs called sedative hypnotics. It acts in your brain to create a calming effect. This medicine is generally restricted to brief treatment intervals of 1 to 2 weeks or less.    Zolpidem may not supply long -lasting but powerful improvement in symptoms of aphasia present in some survivors of stroke. The mechanism for development in these instances remains unexplained and is the focus of present research by several groups, to describe how a drug that acts as a hypnotic-sedative in people who have normal brain function, can raise language capability in individuals recuperating from serious brain injury. Use of zolpidem for this application remains experimental at this time, and isn't formally approved by any pharmaceutical makers of medical or zolpidem regulatory agencies world-wide.    Zolpidem is being examined to ascertain whether it causes regional cerebral perfusion in patients with persistent vegetative states or enhanced responsiveness.    <a title=""How to Help a Loved One"" href=""http://substanceabuserehabs.com/how-to/how-to-help-a-loved-one/"">Seek help now if you or your loved one</a> has signs and symptoms of <strong>Zolpidem addiction</strong>."

271,"How to Do an Intervention ",how-to-do-an-intervention,2014/08/04,"Watching someone destroy his or her own life through addiction is often extremely painful to watch. However, that is the experience that friends and family members of an addict have when their loved one refused to admit that there is a problem with alcohol, other drugs, or whatever the source of the addiction may be. Until that individual is willing to admit that there is a need for help, though, there is often little that anyone else can do.    This is where an intervention comes in. Professionals who carry out formal interventions into addiction believe that the process is helpful, as friends and relatives hold a mirror before their loved ones, urging them to take on their problem before hitting rock bottom and losing their job, health, and family.    When an intervention is powerful, it includes an expression of compassion and concern for the welfare of the addict. Some professionals have the friends and relatives write letters and then read those letters in the presence of the addict at the intervention. The letters give the participants time to figure out what they want to say without coming across as threatening or suddenly turning on the addict.    If you are considering carrying out an intervention for a close friend or relative, there are some steps that you can take to make the process more effective.    First, every participant in the intervention needs training about the disease of addiction before the actual session takes place. There are many people who believe that those who are addicts simply lack discipline in some way. If they would only try a little harder, the thinking goes, they would be able to stay away from alcohol or put the bottle down after one drink. If they just had a little more self-control, they wouldn't keep calling that heroin dealer, or they wouldn't keep compulsively looking at pornography.     Addiction does not work that way; instead, it has to do with the pleasure receptors in the nervous system. As the addiction takes hold, it takes more and more of a particular substance or experience to trip the pleasure receptors and get the good feeling that comes with that experience. Because the addict can no longer draw pleasure the same way that non-addicts do, the compulsion becomes a way of life that is difficult to reverse.    Second, find a neutral place for the intervention. This could be a friend's house, a doctor's office or simply an empty space that does not belong to the addict. Obviously, this should be a place that is private, but neutrality is a definite bonus. This helps the addict hear the other people's concerns in a calm and safe environment, but one to which he does not already have emotional attachments. A discussion in this sort of environment can be much more candid and open.    Third, set a strict time limit for the intervention. In general, the best time frame ranges between 60 and 90 minutes. Interventions that are shorter tend to fizzle out without the necessary emotional depth for the conversation to have the desired effect on the addict. Sessions that run closer to two hours, though, can end up with anger flaring out, as the participants have a hard time maintaining compassion for that long a time, particularly when the addict's behavior has harmed a particular participant.    Fourth, check out the guest list for the intervention. Family members, closer friends and, when appropriate, employers and colleagues all might be good people to invite to the intervention. The broader a spectrum the intervention represents in the addict's life, the more vividly he or she will be able to see the ways in which the addiction is affecting others.    Fifth, set up an addiction evaluation to take place after the meeting. Most addicts will agree to the evaluation after hearing the sentiments of their best friends and relatives and are much less likely to be in denial at that point. Often, the addict is grateful after the intervention, because the focus on self that is a key part of the addiction keeps the addict from seeing what his or her behavior is doing to others. Even if the addict is angry, the point of the intervention is to help the addict see that his or her behavior is causing problems and to become willing to do something to change that behavior -- and solve those problems.    After this stage it is best to contact a local addiction treatment facility as they often times can arrange for your loved one to enter into a treatment facility within 24 hours. "

If you are looking for advice on how to help my addict child, the main thing to remember is that you have to stay calm.    Remain calm when you are confronting your child about their drug use. The confrontation should only take place when you and your child are sober. Bring up any concerns that you may have during the confrontation. Your child has to know that you still care and love them in spite of their drug problems. It is essential to make them feel supported.

Your child may be an adult or teenager but they still need support to overcome the drug problem.  <h2>My Teenager is Addicted to Drugs</h2>  If you have a teenage child who is abusing drugs, you need to make sure they know that there are certain consequences they will face because of their drug use.

Keep track of your child's activities once you find out about their drug problem. You should know where they are at every moment. It is also important to know the kind of company they keep. As a parent, you have to inspect their rooms and the rest of the house for drugs. Check for drugs in their books, shelves, DVD cases, makeup cases, and bags.    Parents also need to address any underlying issues that may have led your teenager to drug use. Their addiction may be caused by other issues at home or school.

While they are in treatment be sure to visit them on family days and participate in family groups. Addiction is a family disease and these group therapies will help educate you on how to support your child during their treatment and throughout the recovery process."
286,"The Important of An Addiction Intervention",the-important-of-an-addiction-intervention,2014/08/04,"If someone you love is suffering from substance abuse, it can be a good idea to plan for an intervention in order to get him or her the help that they need. A well-established intervention will be able to help individuals seek out help for alcoholism, drug abuse, and eating disorders. However, while an intervention can be potentially beneficial, it is important to perform one correctly and to learn when the timing is right for you to stage an intervention in your loved one's life.    An intervention is a process that is often carefully planned, and will involve the help of other friends and family, and sometimes colleague or clergy members, depending on what type of intervention you plan on staging. During this meeting all of the people involved in the person's life will come together and confront them about their addiction, and discuss treatment options with them. Some of the ways in which an intervention can help is that it can provide examples of the individual's destructive behaviors and what kind of impact it has had on their loved ones. Sometimes the people involved in the intervention can prepare a treatment plan that has steps, guidelines, and goals, each of which will be detailed clearly in order to make feature treatment plans seem like they will not be so difficult. Sometimes, in more drastic cases, the individuals involved in the intervention will spell out what they will do if the loved one will not accept treatment. This, however, is often used as a last resort, as the intervention process is designed to establish a safe environment where the addicted individual and his loved ones can speak about the issues openly.    Interventions can help a wide variety of people who are suffering with addictive behaviors, but may be unable to come to terms with their problem, or are unwilling to accept treatment options. Interventions can help people who are suffering from alcoholism, the abuse of street or prescription drugs, gambling addictions, and eating disorders. Sometimes people who have an addiction do not see how their addiction can negatively impact their loved ones. When this is the case, it is important not to wait until your loved one wants help. One of the most important reasons for the addiction intervention is to allow you to present an opportunity for your loved one that they can use to move forward past their dependency.    Arranging for an intervention can be as simple as calling other family members and loved ones and speaking to them about preparing one for the addicted individual. Sometimes it can be a good idea to speak with a professional who specializes in intervention services. These professionals are often called interventionists, though family members may also choose to speak with an addiction specialist, a psychologist or even a mental health counselor who can help you with the planning details. These highly trained individuals have experience organizing interventions, and help walk you through the process in order to make sure that the intervention will be effective. Even if you know what you are planning on doing, sometimes it can be a good idea to have the specialist in the room with you. They can make sure that everything is moving on the right track and that the meeting moves smoothly.    Additionally, it may be a good idea to speak with a professional to help you stage the intervention if your loved one suffers from some of the more adverse effects of the addiction. The specialist will be able to help if your loved one has a history of mental illness or has a history of violence or violent tendencies. They can also be especially important in the intervention process if your loved one has displayed suicidal behavior or if they have recently spoken about or have considered suicide. If your loved one is taking mood altering substances or has a history of violent mood swings, the professional can help keep things level. It is not uncommon for addicted individuals to be in denial about their situations, and sometimes they may act violently in such cases, even if they do not have a history of violence. The professional will be able to help you direct the conversation in the right direction, ensuring that your loved one sees the importance of seeking treatment for their addiction."
288,"What is an Addiction Intervention",what-is-an-addiction-intervention,2014/08/04,"When someone is struggling with some destructive addictive behavior, such as alcoholism, a drug problem or an eating disorder, helping him or her can prove to be a challenge. At times, the road to recovery can begin with a face-to-face and heart-to-heart conversation. However, often a more focused approach becomes necessary to address addiction. Action can be taken by joining forces with others to conduct a formal intervention.    The reason some people struggle with addiction is because they refuse to believe that their situation is problematic or seek treatment for it. The fact that their addictive behavior has negative effects not only on themselves but also on others is often not realized by them. Through an intervention, people like these can gain a structured opportunity so they may change before their situation gets even worse.  <h2>What is an Addiction Intervention?</h2>  An addiction intervention is a process that is carefully planned by anyone who cares about a person who is struggling with addiction, such families and friends and at times even colleagues or clergy members. During the intervention, a group of these people confronts the addict about the outcome of addiction and urges them to willingly seek treatment.    During the intervention:  <ul>  	<li>Particular examples of addictive behaviors are provided along with the their effects on the addict and others</li>  	<li>A prearranged treatment plan is offered with clear guidelines, goals and steps</li>  	<li>Things their loved ones will do if they do not willingly seek treatment are spelled out to the addict</li>  </ul>  <h2>What behaviors warrant an addiction intervention?</h2>  As mentioned, an intervention can prove to be helpful for people struggling with addictive behaviors but who refuse to believe that their situation is problematic or seek treatment for it. An addiction intervention is justified in the case of the following behaviors:  <ul>  	<li>Abuse of street drugs</li>  	<li>Alcoholism</li>  	<li>Compulsive gambling</li>  	<li>Eating disorders</li>  	<li>Prescription drug abuse</li>  	<li>Any Substance Abuse</li>  </ul>  Some people struggling with an addiction may never ""want help,"" so instead of waiting, it is best if the ones who care about an addict's wellbeing perform an intervention.  <h2>How to perform a typical intervention?</h2>  An intervention is proposed by a family member or friend and a planning group is formed. Once an intervention has been performed, the situation can become highly charged and can potentially make the addict feel angry, betrayed or resentful. However, often performing an intervention may become necessary.  <ol>  	<li>The group members explore the extent of their loved one's addiction and investigate the addiction and potential treatment programs. Arrangements may also be made by the group to get their loved one enrolled in a particular treatment program.</li>  	<li>The planning group to personally take part in the intervention forms a team. A date and location are set by the team members and together, a consistent, prepared message and they present an organized treatment plan. The addict should not be informed about what is going on until the day of the intervention.</li>  	<li>If the addict is not willing to undergo treatment, decisions will have to be made regarding what actions will be taken by each member of the team. For instance, contact with children may be taken away from the addict or the addict may be asked to move out.</li>  	<li>All the members of the intervention team should detail specific incidents where problems have occurred as a result of the addiction, such as emotional issues or financial issues. The toll of the addict's addictive behavior should be discussed while care and the hope that the addict can change should still be expressed.</li>  	<li>The addict should be taken to the intervention site without revealing the motive or reason. One by one, each member of the core team should express concerns and feelings. A treatment option should be presented to the addict and should be urged to accept the treatment option right away.</li>  	<li>To help an addict willingly accept and stay in treatment without relapsing, it often becomes critical to involve a family member or the addict's spouse. This way, the addict's everyday living patterns can be changed so that addictive behavior is avoided and the addict gets the opportunity to participate in counseling with a loved one.</li>  </ol>  It is important to carefully plan a successful addiction intervention so that it works as intended. If an intervention is planned poorly, the situation can become worse.  <h2>Don't Delay Seek Addiction Help Today</h2>  If a family member or loved one is suffering from an addictive behavior and is struggling with it, then performing an addiction intervention makes perfect sense to convince them to seek help. An addiction intervention can help put an end to a person's addiction."
290,"Residential Addiction Treatment",residential-addiction-treatment,2014/08/04,"Substance abuse is a huge problem in many parts of the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), up to 250 million people aged between 15 and 64 years use illegal drugs including cannabis, amphetamines, <a title=""Cocaine Abuse Information"" href=""http://substanceabuserehabs.com/cocaine-abuse/"">cocaine</a>, and opioids. The good news is addiction treatment can help people who use these drugs to kick the habit.  <h2>An Overview of Residential Addiction Treatment</h2>  <strong>Residential addiction treatment</strong> is one of the most effective ways of combating drug abuse, according to a report published by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. This treatment program compels patients to remain in a residence for periods ranging from 30 days to 12 months. During this period, patients normally undergo detoxification as well as counseling. Detoxification takes place under medical supervision because patients may experience severe withdrawal symptoms such as hallucinations, seizures, sleep disturbances, vomiting, and delirium tremens. Medical personnel generally use various detoxification regimens to treat their patients.    After detoxification, patients normally undergo counseling with the aim of getting them to discuss the issues that could have led them to start abusing illegal drugs. The counseling sessions can be either group sessions or individual sessions. Furthermore, family members and friends can attend these counseling sessions not only to offer support to their loved ones, but also to attempt to repair broken relationships. Counselors also help patients identify triggers that could lead to relapses. For example, going out to meet with friends who use drugs or visiting neighborhoods and streets where drug dealers operate.    At the end of the treatment period, patients return home and resume their normal activities like going to work or school. However, they continue to attend counseling sessions where they meet with their counselors and other people who have managed to stay drug free after treatment. These follow up counseling sessions are very important because they not only help patients to stay focused, but also help them to fight the temptation to use illegal drugs again.  <h2>Benefits of Residential Addiction Treatment</h2>  Some of the reasons why <strong>residential addiction treatment</strong> programs are so effective include:  <h3>Around-the-clock Care</h3>  Detoxification is not easy because some of the withdrawal symptoms can be life threatening. For example, alcoholics undergoing detoxification may experience alcoholic ketoacidosis, which usually leads to high levels of acid in the blood. This is in addition to symptoms like severe vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, and dehydration. Without proper medical care, one may die. Receiving treatment in a residential setting ensures that they can detox as safely as possible.    Moreover, most facilities that provide medical detox services hire qualified staff including doctors, nurses, psychologists, and counselors to cater to their patients around-the-clock. In contrast, people who receive out patient treatment may be unable to access such professional help every time they need it.  <h3>Treatment in a safe environment</h3>  Receiving treatment in a closed rehab facility ensures patients recuperate in a relatively safe environment. If a patient continues to interact with other drug users or continues to have access to drugs while undergoing treatment, the patient is likely to relapse.  <h3>Holistic approach to substance abuse treatment</h3>  Under residential treatment, patients typically undergo intensive treatment that focuses on various aspects like one's spirituality. In fact, this is one aspect of the counseling process. Other aspects include cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, as well as multidimensional family therapy.  <h2>Conclusion</h2>  Anyone who uses illegal drugs such as cocaine should seek professional help as soon as possible. In general, there are two types of treatment programs available for drug users: outpatient treatment program and residential addiction treatment program. The latter is generally more effective because it offers qualified medical experts around-the-clock, as well as a safe and secure environment far away from negative influences, including drug dealers and friends who use drugs, and patients can even invite their family members to counseling sessions."

Addiction treatment is delivered in many different settings and treatment modalities. They include individual, couples, family, and group therapy formats. The most common form of mental health treatment takes place in a ""therapy"" or ""counseling"" session between an individual and a mental health clinician. There is an abundant of <strong>addiction treatment modalities </strong>for substance abuse and therapy types, which practice works best for you and your circumstances can be overwhelming. Here is a brief synopsis of the most common practices.  <ol>  	<li><a title=""Family Behavior Therapy (FBT)"" href=""#fbt"">Family Behavior Therapy (FBT)</a></li>  	<li><a title=""12 step Facilitation Therapy"" href=""#12step"">12 step Facilitation Therapy</a></li>  	<li><a title=""Motivational Interviewing (MI)"" href=""#mi"">Motivational Interviewing (MI)</a></li>  	<li><a title=""Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)"" href=""#cbt"">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</a></li>  	<li><a title=""Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)"" href=""#emdr"">Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)</a></li>  	<li><a title=""Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT)"" href=""#dbt"">Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT)</a></li>  </ol>  &nbsp;  <h2>Family Behavior Therapy</h2>  Family Behavior Therapy (FBT), which has validated positive results in both adults and adolescents, is aimed at addressing not only <a title=""drug names a-z"" href=""http://substanceabuserehabs.com/drugs-a-z/"">substance use</a> problems but other co-occurring problems as well, such as, depression, family conflict, and unemployment. FBT integrates behavioral contracting with contingency management and education of the disease model, addiction is known as a family disease.    FBT involves the client along with at least one other family member. Therapists pursue engaging families in applying the behavioral strategies taught in sessions and in acquiring new skills to improve the home environment and identified goals. Clients are encouraged to develop behavioral goals for preventing substance use, which are anchored to a contingency management system. Substance-abusing parents are prompted to set goals related to effective parenting behaviors. During each session, the behavioral goals are reviewed, with rewards provided by family members when goals are accomplished. Clients participate in treatment planning, choosing specific interventions from a menu of evidence-based addiction treatment options.  <a id=""12step""></a>  <h2>12-Step Facilitation Therapy</h2>  12-step facilitation therapy is an active engagement strategy aimed to increase the likelihood of a substance abuser becoming affiliated with and actively participate in 12-step self-help groups, thereby promoting abstinence. Three key idea principles:  <ol>  	<li>Acceptance, which includes the realization that drug addiction is a chronic, progressive disease over which one has no control, that life has become unmanageable because of drugs, that willpower alone is insufficient to overcome the problem, and that abstinence is the answer.</li>  	<li>Surrender, which involves giving oneself over to a higher power, accepting the fellowship and structured camaraderie of other recovering addicted individuals, and following the recovery activities laid out by the 12-step program.</li>  	<li>Active involvement in 12-step meetings.</li>  </ol>  &nbsp;  <h2>Motivational Interviewing (MI)</h2>  Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a counseling approach that helps individuals resolve their ambivalence about engaging in treatment and hindering their drug use. MI's goal is to evoke swift and internally motivated change, rather than [to] guide the client stepwise through the recovery process. This treatment model consists of an initial assessment session, followed by two to six individual treatment sessions with a therapist. In the first addiction treatment session, the therapist provides feedback to the initial assessment, inspiring discussion about personal substance use and eliciting self-motivational statements. Motivational interviewing ideologies are used to strengthen motivation and build a plan for change. Coping strategies for high-risk situations are proposed and discussed with the client. In following sessions, the therapist monitors change, reviews cessation strategies being used, and continues to encourage commitment to change or sustained abstinence. Clients sometimes are encouraged to bring a loved one to sessions. MI appears to be more effective for engaging drug abusers in treatment than for producing changes in drug use.  <a id=""cbt""></a>  <h2>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</h2>  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) was developed as a technique to ward off relapse when treating addiction. Cognitive-behavioral strategies are based on the notion that in the development of maladaptive behavioral patterns like substance abuse, learning processes act as an essential role. Individuals in CBT learn to identify and correct problematic behaviors by applying a range of different skills that can be used to stop drug abuse and to address a range of other problems that often co-occur with it.  A central element of CBT is anticipating likely barriers and enhancing clients' self-control by helping them develop effective coping strategies. Specific techniques include exploring the positive and negative consequences of continued drug use, self-monitoring to recognize cravings early and identify situations that might put one at risk for use, and developing tactics for coping with cravings and avoiding those high-risk situations.  <a id=""emdr""></a>  <h2>Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)</h2>  Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a treatment model that was originally performed for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) clients but research has recently found the treatment model useful for an array of struggles including anxiety and depression along with substance abuse. Despite the progresses of medical advancements some mechanisms of the human brain remain a mystery. However, outcomes of EMDR treatment can be theoretically explained. Bilateral stimulation (created by eye movements or alternating tapping on the hands) activates the opposite sides of the brain allowing the brain to release and redefine emotional experiences that are ""trapped"" with in the brain that can easily form into a self-medicating struggle such as substance abuse. EMDR assist to unlock these distressing memories or beliefs as the eye movement or tapping stimulates the two hemispheres of the brain to interconnect with each other. The bilateral stimulation models REM sleep, which is when the brain naturally connects meaning to experiences. While awake in EMDR treatment, the brain naturally attaches meaning to the experience and is assisting in resolving feelings, beliefs, or experience not yet resolved through the brain's natural process. By focusing on identified targets when teamed up with the bilateral stimulation, the negative feelings and beliefs or experience become desensitized, meaning they simply become less bothersome so other healing aspects such as substance abuse can continue.  <a id=""dbt""></a>  <h2>Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT)</h2>  Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) was instituted on the belief that environmental and biological factors that remain undetermined cause some people to respond to emotional states more quickly, and sustain a heightened emotional affect for an extended period of time before they return to baseline. In other words, when one is unable to match an emotion with the situation fittingly. DBT is closely related to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and works well for individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and individuals who utilize self-destructive behaviors such as self-harming, substance abuse, and eating disorders. DBT focuses on a model of emotion that takes into account not only the thoughts that precede a feeling, but also the physiological changes one experiences prior to its. It instills ways to address those changes so that the client can manage emotions in a multi-faceted way. With this a client will learn the skills required to effectively challenge your thoughts and learn how to change their physiology. But, most importantly, a client will learn how to understand and accept their emotions to help keep them from monopolizing their everyday life."

448,"Disulfiram Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",disulfiram-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/11,"Disulfiram is a drug discovered back in the 1920s. At the time, it was used to support the treatment of chronic alcoholism by producing a very acute sensitivity towards alcohol. It blocks the processing of alcohol by the body, thus bringing about an unpleasant reaction whenever alcohol is consumed. In the early 1950s, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved the use of disulfiram to treat cases of alcohol dependence. Wyeth-Ayerst laboratories also began to manufacture the drug during the 1950s. It is highly advised that disulfiram be used only when prescribed by a doctor and in conjunction with support and counseling.    Today, disulfiram tablets are sold under the names Antabus and Antabuse, which are its trade names. Before consuming this drug, one should inform his or her doctor about any history of kidney disease, liver disease, diabetes, thyroid disease, epilepsy and mental disorders or brain damage or if breast-feeding an infant. This is to help the doctor match the viability and dosage of the drug to the individual medical situation. In addition, before the consumption of disulfiram, the patient should seek more information about the drug, have a physical exam, get kidney and liver function tests, and in the case of women, take a pregnancy test. Disulfiram tablets and medication should be kept out of reach of children and should be tightly closed in its original container, stored at room temperature and away from any excess moisture and heat. When no longer in use, the container together with the remaining tablets should be properly discarded.    When patients consume alcohol while taking disulfiram, they experience severe effects of the drug. Some of this effects include; acne or skin rush, nausea, headaches, chest pain, blurred vision, sweating, mental confusion, sore or swollen tongue, difficulty in breathing, anxiety, sweating, and pounding heartbeats. This includes any products that may contain alcohol.    On the other hand, without alcohol some of the side effects are headache, drowsiness and a garlic or metallic taste in the mouth. However, there are more severe side effects that may occur with the consumption of disulfiram. An example of such a severe side effect that may sometimes be fatal is the liver problems that the drug may bring about. You are advised to discontinue the use of the drug and inform your doctor immediately if you start to experience any of the side effects.    One should take disulfiram precisely as the doctor prescribed and if you happen to miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember then take the rest of that day’s doses at intervals that are evenly spaced unless otherwise advised by the doctor. In case you happen to overdose, seek immediate medical attention. Some symptoms of an overdose are; vomiting, nausea, loss of coordination, seizures, numbness and psychotic or aggressive behavior. The treatment of an overdose consists of the administration of glucose, oxygen and sodium ascorbate.    A study that lasted nine years whose report was published in 2006 showed that the incorporation of disulfiram that is supervised together with calcium carbimide which is a related compound in a comprehensive program for treatment resulted in an outstanding abstinence rate of over fifty percent. However, it is important to note that the use of disulfiram does not actually reduce the alcohol cravings. Due to this, poor compliance a major problem. In the year 1986, Fuller et al, performed a study that followed different alcoholics for one year. After the study, he found that there were no statistically significant differences in the abstinence rates between the group that received counseling alone and the group that received the disulfiram prescription. This is because only twenty percent of the group that received the drug actually complied with the treatment. Consequently, some methods to improve the compliance were introduced, for example the sub-dermal implant that releases the drug into the body continuously over time for a period of up to twelve weeks. Another method considered simpler is the supervised administration practices, for instance; a family member may regularly administer the drug to the patient."
450,"Duodin Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",duodin-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/11,"Drug addiction is a common problem affecting millions of people from all across this planet. Duodin is among the commonly abused medicinal drugs across the world.    Duodin is a narcotic drug that works as a pain reliever to manage acute pain. It is made from a combination of the synthetic opiate hydrocodone and acetaminophen. Based on the fact it contains a huge amount of opiate, taking more than the recommended amount can lead to an addiction and have devastating effects in health and life.    Like other addictive drugs, Duodin largely affects the nervous system. An overdose of Duodin can lead to a wide array of signs and symptoms. As a mixture of Hydrocodone and acetaminophen, Duodin comes with the risks of both drugs, and the list is long:  <ul>  	<li>Respiratory depression</li>  	<li>Regular seizures</li>  	<li>Ventricular arrhythmias</li>  	<li>Altered mental status, that is, reduced ability to make informed decisions.</li>  	<li>5 Pupillary constrictions</li>  	<li>Nausea</li>  	<li>Jaundice</li>  	<li>Abdominal pain</li>  	<li>Vomiting</li>  	<li>High blood pressure</li>  </ul>  <h2>Short Term Effects</h2>  Short term effects include dizziness, mental cloudiness, painful urination, drowsiness and anxiety.  <h2>Long Term Effects</h2>  These usually occur after prolonged intake of this drug. They include dependence, liver damage, depression, respiratory complications, clammy skin, coma, yellowing of the skin and eyes.    Patients may experience some withdrawal symptoms when trying to free themselves from Duodin. It is documented that the first withdrawal syndrome occurs between 12-20 hours after the last dose. They include anxiety, cold sweats and flu-like symptoms. However, it is important to note that these symptoms vary from one person to another as there are some biological aspects that may interact with the drug. More often than not, the withdrawal symptoms may overlap the normal side effect of the drug and so it is very important that patients stick to the recommended dosage at all times.  <h2>Two treatment options to treat a duodin overdose</h2>  <ol>  	<li>Primary addiction treatment: This focuses solely on treating the overdose symptoms using a naloxone, a scientifically proven opioid antagonist and N-acetylcysteine, an antioxidant. These two medicines work together to reverse or counter the effects of hydrocodone on the respiratory system especially if the patient experiences breathing problems. N-acetylcysteine helps to protect the liver from damage that would arise from acetaminophen toxicity. The dosage administered largely depends on the patient’s weight, general health, and the foreseen level of liver damage.</li>  	<li>Supportive Duodin treatment: This is usually implemented if the liver is severely damaged by acetaminophen. Some of the treatment options that are used include:</li>  </ol>  <ul>  	<li>IV fluids</li>  	<li>Intubation and ventilation= to ensure that the body gets enough oxygen</li>  	<li>Silymarin</li>  	<li>Benzodiazepines</li>  </ul>  <h2>How to Obtain Rehab for Duodin Addiction</h2>  According to Rehab.com Duodin abuse is a widespread problem in the U.S. 8% of high school senior students confessed to have used the drug for non-medical purposes a year before the survey was done.    There are a number of drug rehabilitation facilities that can help Duodin addicts claim their lives back. However, one has to choose the best so as to get the expected results. Here are some of the factors that you should consider when looking for a rehab facility.  <h2>Legal accreditation</h2>  There are governmental and non-governmental bodies whose main mandate is to ensure that all rehab facilities operate within the stipulated rules and regulations. Those that meet the set threshold are issued with certification documents such as licenses. It is prudent to choose a facility that is accredited by a reputable organization, such as CARF, to enjoy the best services.  <h2>Reputation</h2>  It goes without saying that you should only enroll in a facility that has a positive reputation. If possible, speak to people who have in the past sought the same services to get a clear picture of what to expect. You can also visit the rehab to assess how it’s managed."
452,"Duragesic Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",duragesic-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/11,"In 1991, the FDA approved a drug called Duragesic, a narcotic pain medicine with a transdermal delivery system. Duragesic contained fentanyl, a potent opioid and administered as a skin patch, it relieves patients of moderate to severe pain. The skin patches containing fentanyl deliver dosages from 25 mcg per hour to 100 mcg per hour. The drug has found huge application in relieving chronic cancer pain with its ability to control pain for up to 72 hours. The patch becomes effective after 8-10 hours of application under normal conditions which necessitates its prescription along with other opioids such as morphine sulfate to handle severe pain.    Duragesic is not intended to be used as a pain killer for mild pain or for pain resulting from surgery.  <h2>Duragesic Overdose/Abuse Signs and Symptoms</h2>  Duragesic overdose as well as abuse is a common occurrence due to the fact that proper dose and overdose are separated by a very thin line. The fact that this medication can temporarily impair your reactions and judgment results in accidental overdoses in a number of cases. Most common signs and symptoms of an unintentional overdose or intentional abuse include:  <ul>  	<li>Dizziness</li>  	<li>Slowed breathing</li>  	<li>Clammy or cold skin</li>  	<li>Extreme weakness or fatigue</li>  	<li>Constricted pupils</li>  	<li>Impaired cognition</li>  	<li>Fainting</li>  	<li>Confusion</li>  	<li>Impaired motor skills</li>  </ul>  Besides these symptoms, some victims may experience slowed and impaired breathing, skin rash and swelling of lips, tongue and face. These are symptoms of a severe allergic reaction and warrant an immediate removal of the patch.  <h2>Effects of Duragesic Abuse</h2>  Duragesic has been abused by many in the same manner as other opioid agonists. Persons with family or personal history of mental illness or substance abuse run a higher risk of abusing the drug.    Some short term effects of drug abuse include vomiting, nausea, lightheadedness, constipation, headache, dizziness and drowsiness. The application site may become sore and develop itching, irritation and redness.    More serious abuse may result in a cardiovascular collapse and hypoventilation. The drug has all the potential to quickly cause a fatal hypoxic situation. As already mentioned, fentanyl has a very small window between effective dose and fatal overdose which may qualify as abuse. If accidental overdose occurs at a medical facility, hypoxia can be quickly identified and corrective measures can be taken, but when such abuse takes place outside premises of a hospital, the outcomes are more likely to be fatal.  <h3>Long Term Effects of Duragesic</h3>  Long term effects of abusing this drug include development of fatal respiratory depression which is life threatening. Respiratory depression arising out of excess opioid use may result in respiratory arrest and death, if not identified and treated in time. Such respiratory depression treatment necessitates close observation, use of opioid antagonists and supportive measures depending upon the severity of the patient’s status. If CO2 retention occurs in cases of respiratory depression, sedating effects of opioids can get worse.    Other effects of long term drug abuse are addiction and tolerance. Both these stem out of the fact that over time, neurons in the brain become less sensitive to fentanyl resulting in tolerance to opioids. Addiction occurs when tolerance to fentanyl reaches such a level that the patient stops feeling relief from the drug and indulges in overdoses of the drug to get the same euphoric effect back.    Abusing the drug by chewing or swallowing or using it in ways other than prescribed can result in choking and death.  <h2>Drug Abuse Statistics</h2>  With an increase in the use of Duragesic patches, the supply of patches for abusers to steal has increased. It has been found that patches have been frequently stolen from pharmacies as well as from patients by abusers. Pennsylvania witnessed a rather appalling abuse of the drug when nursing aides were caught stealing Duragesic patches from older patients and ingesting their contents. Statistics reveal that fentanyl abuse related emergency cases rose from 28 in 1994 to over 576 in the year 2000, which is an eye opener. The latest figures have not been disclosed but are expected to be in the thousands. Though Duragesic abuse is less than abuse of drugs such as Oxycontin, a dramatic 2000% increase in Duragesic abuse cases in just a matter of six years is nothing less than alarming."
454,"Duramorph Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",duramorph-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/11,"Duramorph can be described in other terms as morphine sulfate. Duramorph is a natural compound that is obtained from opium. Opium was first introduced to the world when the British colonized India. The British then used opium as a means of trade, and by doing so introduced the product to the world. Once the product got into the hands of common people, they were easily addicted and it became a way of life.    The drug was found to have some health benefits. Duramorph can be used as a pain reliever. In the past the drug was introduced to the people injured in the war, who eventually ended up being addicted at a very high rate. The addiction to the drug ended up acquiring the name of soldier’s disease.    Over time the drug was refined so that it could easily be injected into the body. The injection of the product into the blood stream created a faster effect. Duramorph is used in hospitals, even in the present world, as an analgesic or simply a painkiller. The drug should be administered by a qualified doctor whose interest is for betterment of the patient.    Though having beneficial health purposes, duramorph can be abused for personal gratification. The drug causes a feeling of no pain as it affects the functioning of the nervous system. Constant use of duramorph without a doctor’s prescription can be fatal in the worst case scenario and thus it is vital that people using the drug are identified at an early stage. One can identify a duramorph abuser easily as they are lightheaded, drowsy, have dry mouths, act as if confused and have pinpointed pupils. These are the obvious indicators that a person is a duramorph abuser. Once noted that the characteristics are persistent it can be assumed that the user is a frequent drug abuser.    Ultimately with frequent use of the drug, the effects start becoming more visible. The initial signs of duramorph abuse are the tremors, memory loss, high or low blood pressure, vision problems and abdominal pain. Duramorph is a highly addictive drug that once started the primary effects is easily visible to the outside world. The continuous use of duramorph can lead to one being branded the name “an addict.” The severe effects of being an addict, meaning they use large quantities of duramorph frequently, can be reduced heart rate, fluid in the lungs, a state of stupor, a coma and even death. These long term effects of the drug are usually dire, and in most cases medical assistance is required.    Duramorph being very addictive is very hard to quit and in most cases, one usually needs the assistance of professionals who are aware of how to help the addict cope with the effects of withdrawal. The withdrawal effects are also very much clear as one becomes more anxious, one sweats too much, very many tremors, abnormal skin color and rigid muscles. These effects become more serious depending on the extent to which the user was addicted to the drug.    After a survey, it was found out that the people most susceptible to duramorph are people with the average age of twenty one. In the United States alone the amount spent by users to acquire the duramorph was about five hundred billion dollars over a whole year. Addicts who decided to undergo rehab were put under watch and were found to experience withdrawal symptoms just thirty six hours after undergoing rehabilitation. Due to the addictive nature of duramorph, the relapse rate of addicts was found to be very high as compared to other drugs.    The abuse of the drug is also associated with crime and it was found out that people were mostly introduced to the drug by people they know. The rampant growth of duramorph use indicated that a very high number of people are constantly using the drug. Hospital records also indicate an increase of complications caused by duramorph abuse.    In conclusion, the drug duramorph is seen to increase the number of risks in one’s life, and eventually some lives are lost. By easily identifying the characteristics of a duramorph user, one can help by giving assistance as soon as possible. Educating the public on the effects of duramorph also helps prevent people from becoming addicts."
456,"Ecstasy Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",ecstasy-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/11,"Ecstasy and MDMA are part of the amphetamines category, substances which increase the body's rate of reaction. In the early 20th century, MDMA was synthesized by researchers at the pharmaceutical company Merck. In the 70s, MDMA became a substance widely used in psychiatric and psychotherapeutic work. Now almost 20 years later, ecstasy has been included in the category of illegal narcotics. But it is also a very popular drug, especially on the underground rave club scene.  <h2>Consumption</h2>  Ecstasy comes in the form of pills of different shapes and colors (mostly blue and yellow) and is ingested (swallowed). Ecstasy is a dangerous drug when used extensively and it should be not mixed with any other narcotic substances. For further security the user should:  <ul>  	<li>Not ingest pills of ecstasy bought from unknown people</li>  	<li>Avoid long-term consumption</li>  	<li>Inform people about the composition of the pill for other users and studies</li>  </ul>  <h2>Psychological and physiological effects</h2>  A dose of 80-150 mg of ecstasy has a guaranteed effect of 4 to 6 hours. Ecstasy’s effects depend heavily on the initial state of the user and the location (environment) in which the substance is ingested. Most users say it causes “XTC,” feeling good overall, and confidence in themselves and in others. The world becomes better, life more beautiful, those who are shy become more communicative, and sensory perceptions are intensified (sense of touch, auditory perception, visual perception, etc.).    Ecstasy can also cause altered perception of time, reducing the feeling of fear, reducing obsessions, awareness and bring to light some very old memories and increase sex drive.    In the short term, however, XTC can cause unexpected physiological effects:  <ul>  	<li>Increased blood pressure which can lead to impaired heart, kidney, liver disease or high blood pressure</li>  	<li>Use of Ecstasy in combination with medicinal products such as antidepressant can lead to death</li>  	<li>Asthmatics, diabetics, epileptics and people suffering from psychosis may worsen their condition due to the use of ecstasy</li>  	<li>Loss of appetite, insomnia</li>  	<li>Dry mouth, involuntary teeth clenching takes effect, some users still take half a pill to extend the state of pleasure</li>  </ul>  At this time, there is a risk that the following effects might occur:  <ul>  	<li>Tachycardia</li>  	<li>Sweating</li>  	<li>Fainting</li>  	<li>Cramps</li>  	<li>Panic attacks</li>  </ul>  When these problems occur it is important that the person sits down, calms down, drinks some water or juice. If symptoms persist or worsen, then you ask for first aid (possibly from a healthcare professional).  <h2>Tips for consumers</h2>  Because Ecstasy can cause many adverse physiological and psychological effects (some extremely hazardous), it is very important for the user of Ecstasy:  <ul>  	<li>To eat and be relaxed before taking a pill</li>  	<li>Ingest Ecstasy only in small amounts (e.g. do not take a second dose on the same night)</li>  	<li>Frequently drink water or juice after ingesting a pill of ecstasy, during which it takes effect and thereafter</li>  	<li>To urinate as often as possible both during and after ecstasy effect the effect of past</li>  	<li>To rest as much as possible and not make excessive movement (e.g. dance)</li>  	<li>Wear comfortable clothes (avoid clothes made from nylon, lycra or other materials that do not allow the body to breathe)</li>  	<li>Those who frequently consume Ecstasy are recommended to have a healthy diet (fruits and vegetables) and sleep enough.</li>  	<li>Do not mix Ecstasy with other substances, especially alcohol, other amphetamines or heroin.</li>  </ul>  Nowadays many countries face an increased consumption of Ecstasy and MDMA among users, which got to be the second most spread street drug after Marijuana. It is to be noted that Ecstasy can cause addiction on the long-term, especially if it's used in large quantities or in combination with other substances. Its effects on health are also serious, threatening the life of user in case of abuse or leading to discomfort on the short term. Those who are already daily consumers of Ecstasy and want to regain control over their lives should resort to a treatment center for this purpose.    Psychological coaching is also very important in the recovery process, since Ecstasy and MDMA are drugs which affect mostly the cognitive processes of the brain."
458,"Fentanyl Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",fentanyl-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/11,"Fentanyl is one of the narcotic analgesic drugs. This drug works in the nervous system and in the brain to decrease pain and cause anesthesia. It is therefore used widely during surgery and treatment of pain after surgery. It is available as pills, film, shots, and a skin patch that dissolves into the body, in addition to typical delivery through injection, nasal spray, IV, and oral.    Fentanyl was first synthesized in 1950 in Belgium. The drug is considered to be 80 times more powerful than heroin, according to the DEA. The product should not be used in children less than two years of age.    This drug acts upon particular receptors in the spinal cord and brain to reduce the feeling of pain. It also reduces emotional response to pain. Despite its relative power, its action is quite similar to a number of drugs in the morphine category. Fentanyl is commonly used when a majority of the pain medicines are not working. For people suffering from cancer and who are already using morphine drugs, Fentanyl works quite well in treatment of the cancer pain.  <h2>Signs and symptoms</h2>  It is advisable to be monitored closely by a doctor when you are receiving Fentanyl injection. This gives the doctor the opportunity to determine whether the drug is working properly and whether you should continue using it.    Accordingly, you should notify the doctor immediately if you notice having bluish skin or lips, irregular or pounding heartbeat or pulse, shortness of breath, chest pain, and difficulty with breathing after using the drug. It is important to note that misuse of any narcotic medication can cause overdose, addiction, or even death. This is the case not only for children but even for an individual using the drug with proper prescription.  <h2>Effects of abuse</h2>  Like any powerful drug, Fentanyl comes with many possible side effects, and it is advisable to seek medical attention if you realize the following side effects:  <ul>  	<li>Severe drowsiness, shallow or weak breathing, and slow heart rate</li>  	<li>Confusion. You are totally confused, not knowing what is happening or what you are doing. In addition, you will have trouble in concentrating.</li>  	<li>Light-headedness - This is gives you a feeling that you are likely to pass out.</li>  	<li>Rapid rate and pale skin</li>  	<li>Feeling hot or thirsty, unable to properly urinate, dry skin, and heavy sweating</li>  	<li>Constipation, vomiting, nausea, and loss of appetite</li>  	<li>Feeling tired or weak, mild dizziness</li>  	<li>Dry mouth</li>  	<li>Swelling in your feet or hands</li>  </ul>  This is not the complete list of the side effects of using Fentanyl. You should consult your doctor for further medical advice about the side effects as well as the effects of overdosing. You may also report the side effects to the FDA.    Other issues may occur as a result of the method of delivery, for example reactions to the skin patch. The drug can be safe by following not only the directions for taking the drug but suggestions for mitigating these symptoms. For example, in order to prevent constipation, you are advised to drink plenty of water, exercise, and eat diet rich in fiber. You may also use a laxative. It is also important to note that the severity of the side effects is likely to decrease after you have used the medication for some time.  <h2>Statistics of Fentanyl</h2>  Fentanyl overdose has been attributed to the loss of hundreds of lives in the United States, in January around and in Detroit. A mixture of heroin with Fentanyl is a new fad of getting extra high among heroin addicts, according to various news reports. However, the chemical analysis of this drug captured to use as evidence in heroin related deaths showed that it does not have anything to do with the type of Fentanyl that is found in prescription.  Analgesic and anesthetic drugs that contain Fentanyl are marketed under various brand names that include Sublimaze, Sufenta, Actiq, Duragesic, and Alfenta. Probably the most dangerous form of this drug, over ten thousand times stronger than morphine, is marketed under trade name, Wildnil. The drug is used to immobilize dangerous and large animals.    The safety of Fentanyl was determined after a study of more than 200 patients who took at least a dose of the drug. The trial examined patients aged over 40 years with severe pain induced by the osteoarthritis of the knee or hip and ones who were in need for joint replacement.    According to Chicago Alliance, it is possible to differentiate between fentanyl-laced heroin from the pure heroin in color. The former has minty green color while normal heroin is dusty brown or yellow."

462,"GHB Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",ghb-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/11,"Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid, or GHB, is a substance that occurs naturally in the human central nervous system. It can also be found in wine, beef, small citrus fruits, and almost all animals, though in lesser amounts. It is regulated in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, most of Europe and in the United States of America as it is an illegal drug in several countries.  <h2>GHB in Medicine</h2>  GHB has its uses in the medical field mostly as general anesthetic. Mostly found in the form of a salt, GHB is formed in human cells and is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for reliably increasing slow-wave sleep, so it is used to treat conditions such as insomnia. It is an active ingredient of the salt-based prescription medication Sodium oxybate or Xyrem.  <h2>Recreational use of GHB</h2>  GHB is a depressant used by our central nervous system as an intoxicant. On the street, it is known by many names, G, Liquid X, Liquid E, Georgia Home Boy, Ghetto Home Boy, Juice, Mils, Liquid G, and also fantasy. Its effects are somehow similar to the effects of alcohol and ecstasy. It gives the user euphoria, dis-inhibition, enhanced sensuality, and empathogenic states.    On the symptom side, GHB may also induce nausea, dizziness, visual disturbances, unconsciousness, and even death when used in high doses. When used with alcohol, the effects are dangerous as it can lead to vomiting as well as in-arousable sleep.    GHB is usually taken because it enhances a user’s experiences of being in a club, party, or rave. When taken in small doses, GHB can also act as an aphrodisiac and as a stimulant. For this reason it has been applied medically to treat narcolepsy and depression. GHB is sometimes known as liquid ecstasy due to its ability to create euphoria and sociability and also its use in the dance party scene. This nickname, however, does not imply any similarity to ecstasy as it has entirely separate chemical and pharmacological modes of action.    GHB is usually available in odorless, colorless and tasteless forms that are usually used with alcohol and other beverages. This type of drug had been used to execute sexual assaults, commonly known as date rape, drug rape, or acquaintance rape due to its tendency to sedate and incapacitate victims, which prevents them from fighting back.  <h2>GHB Addictive Potential and Adverse Effects</h2>  GHB has been shown to delay the removal rate of alcohol in humans. This explains the respiratory difficulty that was reported after the ingestion of both alcohol and GHB. A review of 194 GHB-related deaths over a ten-year period showed that most were from respiratory failure triggered by the interaction of GHB with alcohol or other drugs.    Its ability to cause dependence is rapid. Withdrawal symptoms emerge in people who stop using GHB after a few consecutive days of frequent use. Symptoms can include one or a combination of sleeping difficulties, mental dullness, anxiety, tension, chest pain and tightness, muscle and bone aches, sensitivity to external impulses and dysphoria. These symptoms last from a few days up to a few weeks. The withdrawal syndrome can be severe producing acute delirium which usually needs hospitalization in an intensive care unit for management. The combination of mental habituation and physical withdrawal symptoms makes the withdrawal process more difficult as it often leads to heavy use. GHB hangovers are also possible as it is a mild form of withdrawal usually experienced by people who used the drug for not more than one day.  <h2>GHB Treatment</h2>  A lot of GHB users were able to stop using by quitting instantly. Another method in quitting is by tapering down or lowering their GHB usage rate over the course of 14 days. There are reports which state that several heavy users that have the inability to instantly stop using GHB had luck with slowly tapering down their usage over a couple of weeks. Users who withdraw from GHB were usually treated with Benzodiazepine such as valium, barbiturates, and other beta blockers to handle the unpleasant muscle effects that sometimes affect the heart. Antipsychotics were also used in extreme cases.    GHB is a popular drug as people have easy access to it. Drug addiction is continually a problem that we have difficulty dealing with. However, with the right knowledge and information, we can help the users to better themselves, and also to help non-users to avoid these drugs completely."
464,"Halcion Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",halcion-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/11,"Halcion is a medication that is prescribed for the purpose of treating insomnia and sleep-related problems. It allows one to get a good night's sleep by enabling one to fall asleep faster, stay asleep for a longer period of time and keep from waking up in between. This drug belongs to the sedative-hypnotics class of drugs and it is mainly composed of triazolam, a hypnotic agent which comes in white crystalline powder form.    The drug has an immediate effect on the brain and it helps in producing a calming effect on the mind and body. It is generally advisable to use this drug for a period of two weeks maximum and not longer than that. In case the patient's insomnia still persists after administering this drug for two weeks, then the patient needs to seek some other form of treatment. Halcion is ideally meant to be taken by healthy and normal people. Less is always more in case of this drug because overconsumption of the same leads to Halcion drug addiction. Although a useful drug, Halcion can be a curse if not administered properly or if consumed in excess. Ignorance isn’t bliss here, so it is best to keep yourself informed about the correct dosage and precautions to be exercised so that you don’t develop an addiction to the drug.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>  Halcion is a potent drug, which is why it is capable of causing severe symptoms when the patient administers it in doses above the recommended therapeutic level. The drug is even more dangerous when combined with other drugs as birth control pills, barbiturates, ranitidine, cyclosporine, ergotamine, heart medications and anti-depressants. Also, one should avoid taking this along with alcohol. The combination of such drugs can depress the central nervous system greatly and increase the signs of overdose of the drug.    The signs and symptoms of overdose of Halcion are as follows:  <ul>  	<li>Coma</li>  	<li>Seizure</li>  	<li>Slurred speech</li>  	<li>Amnesia</li>  	<li>Impaired motor function</li>  	<li>Depression in the respiratory system</li>  </ul>  <h2>Effects of Abusing Halcion (Short and Long Term)</h2>  In order to not get addicted to Halcion, one should use it at the lowest effective dose and for as short a duration as possible. Prolonged administration of this drug is dangerous because it causes the brain to rewire itself and develop an addiction to the drug. Patients addicted to Halcion need the drug simply to feel normal and to avoid intense withdrawal symptoms. These individuals are also reported to engage in complex and unconscious activities while administering the drug. These activities seem just like any other activity to Halcion addicts and they usually do not remember engaging in them.    Some of the short term effects of abusing Halcion are given as:  <ul>  	<li>Headache</li>  	<li>Anxiety</li>  	<li>Drowsiness or dizziness</li>  	<li>Confusion</li>  	<li>Nervousness</li>  	<li>Irritability</li>  	<li>Tingly sensation or numbness in certain parts of the body</li>  	<li>Loss of Appetite</li>  	<li>Itching</li>  	<li>Blurry Vision</li>  	<li>Burning sensation in the eyes</li>  	<li>Extreme mood swings</li>  	<li>Irregular heartbeat</li>  	<li>Chest pain</li>  	<li>Nausea</li>  	<li>Body aches and fever</li>  	<li>Pale skin and easy bruising</li>  	<li>Slurred speech</li>  	<li>Fast heartbeats</li>  	<li>Weak breathing</li>  </ul>  As far as long-term effects are concerned, Halcion does not have any life-threatening effects, but quality of life is definitely impacted by what can be highly irksome long-term effects. Besides, once individuals are addicted to Halcion, as a result of administering it over longer than two weeks, they have reached the point where they will see serious withdrawal symptoms. These long term symptoms are paranoia, depression, panic attacks, weight loss, distress, anxiety and so on.  <h2>Statistics of Halcion</h2>  According to statistics, Halcion is a commonly administered drug in the context of sedatives and hypnotics drugs. Other commonly used sedative/hypnotic drugs are Temazepam, Lorazepam, Flurazepam and Ativan. In terms of patient statistics, about 68% of females use this drug whereas in case of males the percentage is very less, i.e. just 32%. Thus, it is quite clear from this piece of statistics that females administer Halcion more than males.    Also, about 97.69% of those taking the drug use generic Halcion whereas just a meagre 2.31% use brand. Brand here implies drugs that contain the same active ingredients but are not approved by FDA equivalent. In terms of age, the drug is used most by people over sixty years of age, i.e. a whopping 69.59%! Amongst the individuals who fall in between 40-60 years of age, only 29.24% of them administer Halcion. And finally, only 1.17% of the individuals between 20-40 years use the drug."
466,"Hashish Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",hashish-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/11,"Hashish, along with marijuana, is one of the extremely popular drugs generally used by a wide segment of people. Hashish or simply “hash” is derived from cannabis, made out of its stalked resins known as trichomes.    The state of the hash might be either solid or semi-solid and resin depending upon the form in which it is processed. If it is pressed, the hash will be solid, but if it is treated by water, it will be semi-solid in a paste-like form.    Hashish is usually used in a number of smoking devices like hookahs, pipes, vaporizers, knives, and more. The name “hashish” was derived from the Arabic word for grass. The cannabis plants were originally grown in Morocco and other North African countries. However, historical evidence also points the origins of the drug towards China and Taiwan in 10,000BC.    The medical hashish is cannabis that is usually prescribed by doctors to take care of side effects of AIDS and cancer treatment, like vomiting, nausea, and muscle spasm. Of late, due to the alarmingly high rates of drug abuse, there is much opposition to the use of medical cannabis.    Mainly, hashish is used for recreational purpose and it has been one of the symbols of the hippie movement of the 60s and 70s. It is a mild narcotic drug. However, one could easily get addicted to this drug after abusing it for a few times.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>  Compared to other narcotic drugs, the abuse of hashish or cannabis does not quite have very devastating side effects.

Surprisingly, Canada has a substantial ratio of 12.8 which indicates that there has been a rise in the number of cannabis users in this region as well. The same can also be said for Central American and South American nations.    In 2008, Czech Republic recorded the highest rate with 15.8, higher than most other European nations as well. In UK, as of now, there are a total of 2 million regular smokers of cannabis and hashish. This is quite an alarming trend and a number of measures are being initiated to battle with this trend and reverse it successfully."
468,"Heroin Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",heroin-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/11,"Heroin is an illegal and highly addictive drug used by millions of people all over the globe. These are individuals who are not able to overcome the urge of taking the drug continually on a daily basis, knowing that if they attempt to stop, they will have to face the horrors associated with withdrawal. Just like morphine opium, heroin is made from the resin of poppy plants. Milky sap like opium is removed first from the poppy flower pod and this opium is refined to produce morphine and refined further to make different kinds of heroin.    The drug was first manufactured in 1898 and marketed as remedy for addiction of morphine and tuberculosis treatment by Bayer pharmaceutical company in Germany. During the 1850’s it was already a huge problem in the USA which also led to addiction of morphine as it was prescribed to deal with this problem. By the late 1990s heroin addicts mortality rate was estimated to be as high as 20 times greater than that of the rest of the population. The drug is mostly injected into the body which causes additional risks as the user may end up getting infected with HIV/AIDS in addition to the pain that is experienced because of addiction.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>  Some of the signs and symptoms that a heroin user normally displays include:  <ul>  	<li>Dry mouth</li>  	<li>Shortness of breath</li>  	<li>Sudden change in actions or behavior</li>  	<li>Constricted/small pupils d</li>  	<li>Disorientation</li>  	<li>Droopy appearance</li>  	<li>Cycles of hyper alertness normally followed by sudden nodding off</li>  </ul>  Other signs you can be on the lookout for include:  <ul>  	<li>Syringes or needles that are not used for medical purpose</li>  	<li>Gum wrappers or aluminum foil that has visible burnt marks</li>  	<li>Burned silver spoons</li>  	<li>Missing shoe laces that are used to tie off sites that will be used for injections</li>  	<li>Small plastic bags that have white powdery residue</li>  	<li>Straws featuring burn marks</li>  	<li>Water pipes or any other types of smoking pipes</li>  </ul>  <h2>Effects of Abusing the Drug (Short and Long Term)</h2>  <h3>Effects of using heroin are usually damaging to the user and some of the short term ones include:</h3>  <ul>  	<li>A surge of sensation is normally accompanied by dry mouth and warm feeling on the mouth.</li>  	<li>Slowed breathing normally occurs after a few hours of taking the drug and probably followed by being drowsy for a couple of hours.</li>  	<li>Clouded mental functioning, vomiting and nausea.</li>  	<li>Sedation, hypothermia, coma or even death because of an overdose.</li>  </ul>  <h3>Long term effects</h3>  Continued use of this drug can be very destructive to the body and some of the long term effects include:  <ul>  	<li>Inflammation of gums</li>  	<li>Bad teeth</li>  	<li>Cold sweats</li>  	<li>Constipation</li>  	<li>Weakening of the immune system</li>  	<li>Itching</li>  	<li>Respiratory illness</li>  	<li>Coma</li>  	<li>Reduced sexual capacity and even long term impotence in men</li>  	<li>Menstrual disturbance for the ladies</li>  	<li>Inability to achieve orgasms for both men and ladies</li>  	<li>Loss of intellectual performance and memory</li>  	<li>Depression</li>  	<li>Introversion</li>  	<li>Insomnia</li>  	<li>Loss of appetite</li>  	<li>Pustules on the face</li>  </ul>  <h2>Statistics of Drug</h2>  Heroin has been studied for more than 100 years which makes its statistics well known.

The average user normally consumed between 150 mg and 250 mg of heroin every day in 2007. It was reported that at least 93 % of the opium supply was sourced from Afghanistan. This is the raw material that is used for heroin supply with an export value of about $4 billion. Studies have also shown that overdose of the drugs has caused more deaths in the past years than traffic accidents and about 4out of every 5 deaths that are related to drugs were caused by heroin. There are millions of people worldwide who need to seek treatment but they are simply not.    It is important for everyone to be warned that even a single dose can lead you on the path of destruction. Most people especially young ones normally get hooked as a result of peer pressure where they want to become popular and look cool. Drug dealers driven by their love for money and profit will approach you as a friend seeking to help you out. Most of the dealers do not even use it as they are aware of the dangers that lurk ahead. For this reason, it is important to avoid temptations or if you have a loved one going through this try and get them help to get their life back on track."
470,"Hycodan Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",hycodan-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/11,"The drug hydrocodone is sold under the brand name of Hycodan. Hydrocodone is a semi-synthetic opioid derived from natural opiates such as codeine and thebaine. Hycodan is an oral medicine commonly prescribed for cough. It is a narcotic analgesic as well. Hycodan is available in the markets in the form of capsules, tablets, and syrup.    Hydrocodon is normally combined with non-opioids such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, which are less effective, thereby discouraging people from abusing the drug or using it for recreational purposes. Hycodan is available only in combination with other substances and its applications are based on the substance it is combined with. In the US, Hodrocodone is a controlled substance.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Hycodan Abuse</h2>  Hycodan abuse may be hard to spot because the symptoms are very subtle. They may also vary from person to person. An abuse or overdose of the drug usually causes behavioral changes in the person. Few commonly observed signs and symptoms of Hycodan abuse are:  <ul>  	<li>A person going for frequent purchases of the drug.</li>  	<li>Trying to see more than one doctor for the same problem in order to double up on Hydrocodone prescriptions.</li>  	<li>Desire to remain secluded from other people.</li>  	<li>Spending money quickly.</li>  	<li>Focusing more on Hycodan as a solution to the ailment than anything else.</li>  	<li>Mood swings</li>  	<li>Sudden, unwarranted behavioral changes.</li>  </ul>  <h2>Effects of abusing Hycodan</h2>  Hycodan abuse may have several short term as well as long term effects, disastrous for the user’s health. Some common immediately visible effects of Hycodan overdose include:  <ul>  	<li>Constipation</li>  	<li>Anxiety</li>  	<li>Dizziness</li>  	<li>Headache</li>  	<li>Drowsiness</li>  	<li>Fatigue</li>  	<li>Weakness</li>  	<li>Nausea</li>  	<li>Trouble sleeping</li>  	<li>Loss of appetite</li>  </ul>  More serious short term effects of hycodan include:  <ul>  	<li>Bloody stools</li>  	<li>Rapid or irregular heartbeat</li>  	<li>Breathing problems</li>  	<li>Trouble urinating</li>  	<li>Severe allergic reaction such as rash, hives, itching or swelling</li>  </ul>  The Hycodan experience may vary from user to user as well as with the amount of drug used. Hycodan also affects people of different weights and sizes differently. As more and more time passes with the user continuing to abuse Hycodan, he or she may begin experiencing lack of focus and concentration. Anxiety and nervousness which have been mentioned as short term effects may now be accompanied by shakes and tremor. There may also be hot and cold sweats, soreness in the body and occasional chills.    One of the most severe long term effects of hycodan abuse is addiction. Hydrocodone which is a content of Hycodan is an opiate similar to heroin and morphine. These substances are very risky, primarily due to the fact that even when on recommended dosage, they can be addictive. More use of Hycodan results in tolerance in which brain cells become used to the drug and more is needed to experience the same results. Tolerance often results in addiction.    Long-term effects of Hycodan abuse may result in physical problems such as liver damage and hearing loss. The most damaging long-term effect of hycodan abuse may be the suffering in family life. Hycodan addiction leads to a wreckage in family relationships, troubled mental health, and difficulty in handling regular tasks.  <h2>Hycodan Abuse Statistics</h2>  Data held with American Association of Poison Control Centers reveals more than 27,000 cases of hydrocodone abuse which sought treatment for related issues in the year 2009 only. These numbers include patients who underwent counseling as well as those who had to resort to the services of an emergency room. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health found more than 23 million people above 12 years of age misusing or abusing Hycodan. Besides Hycodan, these people resorted to other brands such as Norco, Vicodin and Lortab as well.    The number of teens and young adults abusing Hycodan is surprising. Monitoring the Future Survey of 2010 asked a number of junior high and high school students about their interaction with hydrocodone in any form. The survey found that approximately 8 percent of high school seniors had used the drug without any prescription from a medic. It also revealed that more than 7 percent of juniors had abused hydrocodone at some point in their lives.    Although Hycodan is not available in the form of a single ingredient and is offered only as a combination, it is extremely important to take care of the fact that it is taken only per the physician’s advice. Its use must be limited to a minimum and discontinued when the doctor so suggests."
472,"Hydrococet Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",hydrococet-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/11,"A brand of the generic drug hydrocodone, Hydrococet, is a narcotic drug that is used as a painkiller and fever reliever in various medical situations. It is one of the most prescribed drugs in the United States and works through interrupting pain signals traveling to the brain from the central nervous system. The ingredients of the drug are hydrocodone, a narcotic pain reliever, and acetaminophen, which is non-narcotic.    Several generic version of the drug exist on the market today in form of capsules, syrups, and tablets. Like other narcotic drugs, hydrococet is highly addictive and even if it is prescribed by a doctor, addiction may occur when it is misused. Addiction potential usually vary from person to person depending on the individual’s biological structure. The risk of addiction usually increases if the user has a history of abusing alcohol or other drugs. Most doctors usually combine the drug with other painkillers such as ibuprofen and paracetamol to make it more effective and abusers may need to enroll in a rehabilitation center to overcome the addiction.    In previous years, the drug could be found on the streets because of the pleasure associated with them. Most people would use them without prescription from the doctor. However, due to the addictive nature of the drug, manufacturers are forced to minimize their supply to street dealers and instead replace it with a newer form, the slow-release capsule that has fewer side effects.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>  Signs of addiction to the hydrococet drug vary greatly between the users, and they may not be easily identified. Most patients usually become addicted to the drug when taking the medication as prescribed by a physician while others get addicted when taking the drug recreationally. The most obvious signs and symptoms of addiction include:  <ul>  	<li>Withdrawal symptoms, where an individual prefers to spend time in seclusion. This is usually accompanied with a sudden change in social behavior and interests.</li>  	<li>The person may constantly request for refills of the drug, and may end up seeing multiple doctors for additional prescriptions of the drug.</li>  	<li>Financial problems as more is spent on the drug. Abusers may also start borrowing or stealing from others in order to purchase the drug.</li>  	<li>Mood problems – These may include abnormal moods whether cheerful or despondent as well as extreme anxiety and euphoria.</li>  	<li>Physical symptoms that a hydrococet addict may suffer from include nausea and vomiting, pupil constriction, light-headedness as well as dizziness, a dry throat and itching. Some may develop complications with urination.</li>  </ul>  <h2>Effects of Abusing the Drug, Long-Term and Short-Term</h2>  One of the major effects of abusing hydrococet is physical and psychological dependence on the drug, and the quantity of intake usually becomes more and more as the body develops tolerance towards the drug.    Short term effects of abusing the drug are usually common, and very similar to the effects of abusing heroin and morphine as the drug causes tranquility and excitement to the user. Depending on the person taking the drug and frequency of intake, addiction may occur within two to four weeks, and with time, the body’s tolerance may produce the need for higher quantities to achieve the same feelings of euphoria.    Hydrococet is usually mixed with acetaminophen to reduce the effects of the narcotic in the drug. However when the acetaminophen is taken in large quantities it causes liver damage, which is irreversible and may lead to death. Other physical effects of the drug may include frequent severe headaches, seizures, high blood pressure and blurred vision.    Alcohol abusers are usually at a higher risk since combining the drug with either alcohol or benzodiazepines may completely hinder respiration and death may occur. Although very few long-term effects of the drug exist, psychological damage to the individual may last a life time, unless the person seeks immediate medical assistance or enrolls for a rehabilitation program.  <h2>Statistics of the Drug</h2>  Hydrococet is known as one of the most commonly abused prescription drugs in the United States. It was recently estimated that more than five million people in the country abuse the drug each year, with about 87 people dying from misusing the drug, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The National Institute on Drug Abuse also reports that in 2009, Hydrococet was responsible for 104,490 hospital emergencies.    The American Association of Poison Control Centers on the other hand reports that over 27,000 people were treated for complications associated with hydrococet abuse during the same year. Most of these people use generic forms of the drug as well as brands related to Hydrococet such as Norco, Lortab and Vicodin."

476,"Hydromorphone Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",hydromorphone-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/11,"There are many painkillers on the market produced for various levels of pain from moderate to mild, severe and chronic. Hydromorphone refers to a type of pain reliever prescribed for patients suffering moderate to severe pain. This drug is very potent and falls under the class of opiate analgesics (legally known as narcotics). This prescription is only given to those who are experiencing pain for longer than just a few days. It alters the way brain responds to pain signals and induces pleasure to further relieve one of the pain. These drugs however have the potential to cause dependence and addiction, which is why careful use should be applied with only a doctor’s prescription. They also cause various reactions generically termed as symptoms and signs of usage.  <h2>Hydromorphone Signs and Symptoms</h2>  As a common characteristic of most opiates, there are a number of side effects (symptoms) associated with the use of Hydromorphone. Some of these symptoms are common while others are rare and occur in specific conditions. The rare signs may be facilitated by allergies, in combination with other medications (sedatives, tranquilizers, sleeping pills…etc.), or substances such as alcohol. There are other symptoms associated to starters (those who have never used this kind of treatment before) and change of dosage. Besides, Hydromorphone also exhibits mild withdrawal symptoms. Any activity involving these drugs should therefore be in strict abidance with the doctor’s guide to ensure no fatal consequences result. Some of the common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, dizziness and drowsiness, light-headedness, mood swings, itching, sweating and flushing. If these symptoms persist and or are severe, the doctor should be consulted. The rare effects are much more risky and require immediate address from the doctor. They include rashes, hives, hoarseness, slowed/difficulty in breathing and swallowing, seizures and fainting. Others include swollen face, eyes, lips, mouth, tongue, throat, hands, arms, lower legs, ankle or feet. There may be other side effects causable by Hydromorphone, and it is therefore important to contact your doctor in case of any unusual characteristic while under this medication.  <h2>Effects of Hydromorphone Abuse and Addiction</h2>  Hydromorphone basically affects the brain’s receptors by binding them and preventing one from perceiving pain. It simultaneously stimulates pleasure points that cause a calming sensation. For these reasons, the body becomes heavily accustomed to such effects, leading to addiction. There are many cases of substance abuse particularly morphine derived drugs and other opioid analgesics. One may also suffer both physical and psychological dependence which require them to continue using the drug even when the pain is long gone. Other patients simply decide to exceed the prescribed amounts (overdose) which harbor tremendous negative consequences. Overdose may lead to slow breathing and heartbeat, fainting, coma, sleepiness, muscle weakness, cold dank skin and widening or narrowing of the pupil causing blurred vision. Abuse and addiction have various effects that cut across all areas of an individual’s life from psychological to emotional, physical, behavioral and social. Psychological effects include delusion, hallucination, paranoia and depressions. Physical effects comprise respiratory depressions, seizures, coma, strokes, hear attacks, blurred vision, stomach pains and urination difficulties. Anxiety, mood swings, irritability and agitations, theft, lying and reckless behavior are also effects associated with addiction and abuse of substances such as Hydromorphone.  <h2>Hydromorphone Statistics</h2>  Reports from national institutions that handle substance regulation and addictions have indicated that more teens get hooked on addictive drugs including Hydromorphone. According to NCASA (national center on addiction and substance abuse), 75% of high school students have tried using such drugs and 45% of that population still use illegal substances. Other statistics released in 2006 suggested that 20 million people aged above 12 years were illicit users of dilaudid which is a main component in Hydromorphone. Most users unfortunately do not practice it for medicinal purposes but rather for relaxation. The number of hardcore substance abuse (narcotics including Hydromorphone) rose 114% between 2002 and 2006. There has also been a rise in the number of deaths reported from such activities. It is therefore important for everyone to desist from using such drugs without clear guidelines from professional medical practitioners.  <h2>Conclusion</h2>  The use of Hydromorphone should only be based on a professional doctor’s prescription. Although the drug can be recommended for treatment of other problems, it is recognized as a pain reliever. It has a number of side effects and has been proved to cause dependence and abuse if not correctly managed. Hydromorphone abuse can lead to premature death and patients are therefore advised to practice ultimate precaution in the use of this drug. Nonetheless, it is a good prescription that relieves moderate to severe pain."
478,"Kadian Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",kadian-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/11,"Kadian is extensively used as a pain killer. The main composition of this drug is morphine which is an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. It cures pain ranging from minor to severe. This drug is mainly used to get relief from round the clock pain. And it can be used on daily basis for common causes of pain. Patients suffering from severe asthma and breathing problems, intestinal disorders and symptoms of constipation are strictly advised to stay away from this drug.    Kadian if taken by patients without following the proper prescribed dosage then may cause severe harm to their health. Morphine, the main component of Kadian is highly responsible for causing serious breathing problems to the users. To neutralize the harmful effect of Kadian it is suggested to take it with other drugs given by the physician. The risk of breathing problems increases even more with the increase of doses. In case, after consumption of Kadian, the patient experiences slow breathing, he should immediately get medical help.    Besides being a painkiller, Kadian has high possibilities of misuse and abuse by the patients, as opioid agonists are likely to be abused by drug addicts and alcoholics. As such, the doctors and physicians prescribe a proper strict dosage of Kadian keeping in mind the chances of its abuse by patients suffering from drug or alcohol addiction or persons having a criminal history. While prescribing Kadian patients are strictly instructed to swallow the whole capsule at a time or to dust the capsule contents on applesauce and consume directly without grinding between teeth. If the capsules are crushed, chewed, snorted, dissolved or injected by the patients they can meet up with a fatal situation, like overdose and death due to a speedy discharge of the opioid morphine. By mistake if children are exposed to the accidental consumption of this drug, it could mean a severe health disaster or even death caused by the overdose of morphine.

480,"Kapanol Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",kapanol-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/11,"Kapanol refers to a type of morphine sulfate medication administered to patients who are suffering acute to severe pain whether temporary, chronic or long-term. It is a type of opioid analgesic that acts on the opioid receptors found in the nervous system to reduce pain sensation. Kapanol acts effectively in soothing pain and is also used to treat diarrhea and pulmonary edema. It also results in cough suppression and can also be administered to lung cancer patients to relieve severe cases of breath shortness. However, this morphine has a tendency to result in addiction when used for a long time like in cases of chronic pain treatment. Those using this form of medication also exhibit various symptoms and signs that may develop to cause addiction after several months.  <h2>Signs and symptoms</h2>  There are many side effects which also comprise the symptoms of using this drug. Some of these symptoms are common across majority of the population with stable health conditions while others are rare. The common side effects include vomiting and nausea, dry mouth, dizziness and drowsiness, difficulty in urinating, itchy skin, and constipation. Rare symptoms include confusion, hypothermia, blurred vision, hallucination, hives, heart rate alteration, flushing, rigid muscles and abdominal pain. These are usually due to allergic reactions or combinations with other medication whose formulas do not work in harmony with Kapanol. Wheezing and swelling of the mouth may also be witnessed.  <h2>Effects of Kapanol abuse</h2>  Kapanol is a slow release drug and should be taken once or twice a da, depending on the type of dose, 40mg should be used once every 24 hours at the same time each day as prescribed unless ordered by the doctor. The 20mg should be taken after every 12 hours. When this drug is used in excess or abused without prescription, there may be severe and sometimes fatal consequences. These conditions include weak pulse, low blood pressure, constipation and stomach spasms, and difficulty in breathing, blue fingernails and lips as well as seizures. At severe instances, it may lead to coma or no breathing at all. Kapanol has a high potential of resulting in addiction when used for a long period and withdrawal may cause mild reactions. This drug is capable of causing physical dependence, psychological dependence as well as tolerance. This is because the morphine binds the brain receptors to not only relieve pain, but also induce feelings of pleasure which often result in abuse. Since it is prescribed to relieve pain, true addiction may not be apparently identified. Addiction may lead to negative disorders including memory loss, blurred or double vision, loss of appetite, altered thinking patterns and inability to carry out tasks. It also has a negative effect on the social ability and can cause irritations.  <h2>Kapanol Statistics</h2>  Kapanol is a morphine brand manufactured in Europe and Australia, although most abusers in other countries can easily access it from online stores. This drug prescription is highly monitored and only permitted in cases of severe pain where conventional pain relievers are ineffective. There has been a rise in the number of people using morphine related drugs including Kapanol. In the US alone, the number of such uses rose from 2.6 million to 5.2 million between 1998 and 2006. In 2002, there were a reported 5,528 deaths resulting from morphine sulfate poisoning. The high amount of misuse is common among those between the age of 20 and 64 according to CDC (centers of disease control). CDC also reported that 35,000 deaths occurred in 2008 as a result of drug overdose and morphine substances alongside narcotics led the list.  <h2>Conclusion</h2>  Kapanol is a very effective painkiller that acts first to sooth patients suffering intense pain sensations. However, it is a morphine sulfate derived from opium origins, and therefore it has a high addiction potential. Most patients after their first introduction to this drug end up abusing it due to the pleasure it arouses. This may result in severe damage if the habit is continued for a long time. Besides, withdrawing from Kapanol use is a process that happens in phases and also has various symptoms. It is important to use this drug only as prescribed by the doctor and for no different reason other than that ordered. The dose should only be altered on a doctor’s advice and termination should follow similar suite."
482,"Ketamine Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",ketamine-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/11,"Ketamine is a drug used for initiating and maintaining general anesthesia on both humans and animals. The drug is also used as a sedative in intensive care or analgesic, especially in emergency situations. Ketamine is categorized as a dissociative agent just like phencyclidine (PCP) and tiletamine. As an anesthetic, the drug is used for minor procedures or as an induction agent and followed by muscle relaxant as well as tracheal intubation. In medical settings, the drug is injected intramuscularly or intravenously. Due to its ability to suppress breathing mildly unlike other anesthetics, it is still commonly used in human medicine; however, it is rarely used as a primary anesthetic as it causes hallucinations.    The effect of this drug on the circulatory and respiratory system is different from other anesthetics. When used sparingly in anesthetic doses, the drug stimulates rather than slowing the circulatory system. In some instances it is possible to perform ketamine anesthesia without using protective measures to the airways. In addition, the drug is an effective pain reliever and is often used in sub-anesthetic doses to manage acute pain. In spite of this, physicians must take into account its psychotropic nature as patients usually report experiencing hallucinations and other negative psychological effects while anesthetized. As result of these unpleasant side effects physicians have reduced the use of the drug in human medicine; however these adverse effects can be mitigated by use of sedatives such as benzodiazepine.    Ketamine functions by interfering with the transmission of pain in the spinal cord. It also inhibits production of nitric oxide, a neurotransmitter involved in reception of pain which further contributes to the analgesic effect. The drug usually blocks voltage-sensitive calcium channels and lowers sodium channels attenuating hyperalgesia.    Unlike other popular dissociatives such as DXM or PCP, Ketamine is quite short-acting. The drug takes effect within 10 minutes. Its hallucinatory effect usually lasts about 2 hours when taken orally and 60 minutes when injected or insufflated. At lower doses the drug produces a dissociative state which is often characterized by a feeling of separation from the physical body and the external world. This condition is commonly referred to as derealization or depersonalization. At high doses users may experience a sensation known as K-hole. This is a state of extreme dissociation accompanied by auditory and visual hallucinations.    People who abuse this drug have similar characteristics to those who abuse alcohol except that the smell of alcohol is absent. Signs and symptoms of a person using this drug include:  <ul>  	<li>Empty bottles</li>  	<li>Pill packets</li>  	<li>Needles</li>  </ul>  Ketamine is a very unusual drug even when used in the short-term due to its dissociative effect. It usually induces euphoria and hallucinations which can be quite frightening. If the user combines it with alcohol, they are likely to make a bad situation worse as they are likely to experience respiratory depression. This refers to a condition where the heart and lungs stop working because they are too relaxed. On the other hand if the person vomits, they are unable to clear their airways due to paralysis, this often leads to choking and death.    Ketamine is a dangerous drug when used in the long-term. The drug usually affects almost every area of the body. These effects include accidental injuries.    These often occur without the user noticing since the drug is an anesthetic. People using this drug are known to break limbs and continue using them, leading to further damage as they do not feel pain. Such aggravated injuries results in compounds fracture or sepsis.  <h2>Bladder</h2>  The drug is known to cause long-term damage of the urinary tract and bladder. It makes the walls of these organs thick and eventually the user may no longer be able to pass urine.    Recreational ketamine is often mixed or cut with other harmful drugs including amphetamines which can result in high blood pressure. In addition it could be mixed with sinister drugs such as acetaminophen or potent detergents. Other effects closely linked with use of the drug are abdominal pain, neuronal impairment and kidney complications.    Abuse of Ketamine seems to be on the rise among the youth. Studies indicate that more than 1.7 % of 12th graders had experimented with this drug in 2009.The drug is popular among the youth since it is a prescription pain reliever. In spite of the dramatic increase in use of this drug over the last decade, most of the young people who use it are not aware of its damaging effects and potential for dependency."
484,"Laudanum Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",laudanum-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/11,"Laudanum is extracted from opium. It contains a high amount of morphine, which makes it a drug that is able of affecting both the mood and behavior of its user. It has an extremely bitter taste when left untreated, and it is reddish-brown in color. As of now, it is still a prescribed drug that is used for minimizing pain, easing withdrawal symptoms in babies born to drug addicted mothers, and controlling diarrhea. The risk of substance abuse is extremely high, which makes it a prescribed drug only. When it comes to abuse of the drug, it can be used with alcohol and other opiates, and there is an extreme chance of both psychological and physical dependence.  <h2>History Of Laudanum</h2>  It is often called the heroin of the 19th century, and was in high use during the Victorian era. Besides being given for medical treatment, women of the era used it to get a popular look of pale skin. Besides being used for vanity, it is safe to say that Laudanum has a long history of prescribed treatment as well as abuse. In fact, it was the first prescription opiate drug in America to cause addiction.    Even though people eventually became aware that addiction was possible and prevalent, many people still used it. In fact, many writers and artists of the time used it or were addicted to it. Some people that were addicted to the drug include Charles Dickens, Edgar Allen Poe, John Keats, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron. Most often people became addicted to it after being prescribed the drug for an ailment.    In the 1500's, Laudanum was used to help with a wide variety of ailments. This is because laudanum was highly effective at easing pain, and doctors of the time assumed that it would be good for other medical purposes as well. Many of the ailments it was used for were life threatening at the time but are no longer such. For example, laudanum was used to treat diarrhea, which took the lives of many people who suffered from the cramping and dehydration. It was also used to treat larger issues, such as heart disease, asthma, depression, kidney stones, yellow fever, colic, and tuberculosis.    It's main and most effective use, however, was to provide pain relief. It was sold without a prescription until the early 20th century; therefore, everyone had access to Laudanum and it was a common drug during the time.    It was also an easy drug to make, using 10% opium and 90% alcohol. It was often flavored with cinnamon or saffron to help eliminate the natural bitter taste. Doctors prescribed it to patients as a pain killer for all kinds of ailments, including cramps and tuberculosis. And during the time when Laudanum was popular, even babies and children were given the drug to ease their pain. Because use of this drug was so widespread, by the time it was discovered that Laudanum was highly addictive many people were already addicted and became life-long addicts.  <h2>Signs And Symptoms Of Laudanum Use</h2>  Addiction to Laudanum can affect a person's personal and professional life profoundly. Early signs of addiction to Laudanum include taking Laudanum for issues other than prescribed, increasing amounts of dosage due to reduced responsiveness, and going through withdrawal symptoms when there is no access to the drug such as nervousness, insomnia, agitation, vomiting, nausea, hallucinations, and cold-like symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can occur almost immediately, from a half an hour after last dose, or up to one day after the last dose.  <h2>Effects Of Abusing Laudanum</h2>  The short-term side effects of Laudanum parallel the short-term side effects of morphine and include physical dependence, depression, dry mouth, euphoria, sedation, vision problems, clammy skin, itching, shallow breathing, body terrors, lethargy, agitation, seizures, dizziness, drowsiness, low blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, weakness, wheezing, skin rashes, anxiety, and constipation.    Long-term side effects include addiction, liver problems, and death. Furthermore, a tolerance to the drug can build up, which means that higher dosages will be needed to experience desired effects.    An overdose of the drug can result in severe respiratory issues and death.  <h2>Statistics Of Laudanum</h2>  During the period between January 2004 and October 2012, only 2 people reported constipation to the FDA from taking laudanum, while 4 drug adverse reaction reports were made. It is important to note that reports are often only made when the occurrences are severe or critical.    In 2012, 0.55% of the population between the ages of 15-64 was addicted to opiate drugs such as Laudanum."
486,"Librium Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",librium-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/11,"Librium was discovered accidentally when scientists were trying to concoct a completely unrelated chemical substance. Hence it was among the first drugs to be synthesized in a lab. Also known as chlotdiazepoxide, it is a benzodiazepine drug or an anti-anxiety drug. The drug comes in either capsule or tablet form at inject-able form and in varying dosages, mostly based on the user’s medical condition, age, and response to treatment.    After a serious examination of this drug, scientists discovered that small doses of it are capable of reducing fear and anxiety before undergoing surgery and treating withdrawal symptoms and anxiety disorders due to alcoholism. The drug accomplishes this by slowing down chemical reactions in the brain.    Almost as soon as it was discovered and prescribed to patients, problems arose even with its derivatives. The drug proved to be addictive making people using it become dependent upon it. The worst was that its dependents had to use more of it in order to maintain wellness. Fortunately the signs and symptoms behind abusing Librium were discovered:  <ul>  	<li>Headache causing sleep disturbances</li>  	<li>Changes in libido – either increased or decreased interest in sex</li>  	<li>Drowsiness</li>  	<li>Diarrhea</li>  	<li>Nausea</li>  	<li>Weakness</li>  	<li>Confusion</li>  	<li>Blurred vision</li>  </ul>  Taking this drug while performing activities like operating machinery that require clarity of thought can cause accidents.    On the other hand, there are also signs and symptoms associated with withdrawal from Librium. They include:  <ul>  	<li>Irritability</li>  	<li>Tremor</li>  	<li>Insomnia</li>  	<li>Muscle cramps</li>  	<li>Severe dizziness</li>  	<li>Stomach or abdominal pain</li>  	<li>Sweating</li>  </ul>  Like any other drug out there, Librium has its own side effects if used inappropriately. However, some of these side effects could be avoided by following simple instructions from the doctor. People using this drug should not use it for a longer period of time than prescribed by the doctor, should not suddenly stop using it without the doctor’s approval, or increase the dosage for any reasons. This is important for the purposes of minimizing any long term and short term side effects. Let’s see some of the short term and long term effects of abusing chlordiazepoxide.  <h3>Short term effects:</h3>  <ul>  	<li>Irregular menstrual periods for women</li>  	<li>Skin rash</li>  	<li>Fatigue</li>  	<li>Vomiting, nausea and constipation</li>  	<li>Swelling or itching of your throat, face, tongue, or lips</li>  	<li>Difficulties in breathing and walking</li>  	<li>Trouble urinating</li>  	<li>Fainting</li>  </ul>  <h3>Long term effects:</h3>  <ul>  	<li>Yellowing of the eyes or skin (jaundice)</li>  	<li>Depressed mood, thoughts of committing suicide</li>  	<li>Hallucinations</li>  	<li>Restless muscle movements in your neck, eyes, jaw, or tongue</li>  	<li>Confusion</li>  	<li>Hyperactivity, hostility, agitation</li>  	<li>Dark urine</li>  	<li>Slurred speech</li>  </ul>  Librium may be habit forming and therefore should only be used by the person it was described for. It should never be shared with any other person especially someone who has a history of drug addiction or abuse. The drug should not also be used while taking alcohol because it tends to magnify the effects of alcohol. Combining chlordiazepoxide with alcohol can be life threatening. Therefore, don’t.  <h2>Librium Statistics</h2>  Some quick statistics from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) show that there were 38,329 deaths in the USA due to drug overdose. The American Psychiatric Association puts at 11-15% the percentage of Americans who have a bottle of Librium in their medicine cabinet.  <h2>Bottom line</h2>  It is also very important to speak with a health care provider before starting, stopping or changing the dose because of its serious side effects. Apart from abuse, this drug is recommended by most health practitioners because of its powerful healing effects within a short period of time."

The medication contains a mixture of hydrocodone and acetaminophen and is normally giving to patients suffering from mild or severe pain. It is also important to note that it is classified as a controlled substance (schedule III). Patients should also know that it has the potential for abuse and dependence. This implies that it should only be taken as long as it has been prescribed in the proper amounts.    If a person is sensitive to opioids or allergic to any of the ingredients that are used to manufacture it, they are highly recommended to speak to their doctor before going ahead and taking the drug. That way they can avoid problems they may regret in the future. In fact, you should let the doctor know your medical history to be advised accordingly. The drug may also cause some difficulties in diagnosis as well as treatment of various abdominal conditions. You should also not be quick to give it to children as its effectiveness and safety among children has not been established.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>  Since Lorcet is a highly addictive drug thanks to the hydrocodone (opiate-based) component of the medicine, there are some signs and symptoms you should be on the lookout for to see if someone you know and/or love is abusing the drug:  <ul>  	<li>Going to different health care providers to that they can prescribe the drug or even moving from one doctor to the next so as to obtain the drug.</li>  	<li>Going through a prescription faster that he/she should be.</li>  	<li>Repeated reports stating that the prescription is lost or has been stolen.

It has also been observed that more than 60% of new users of these drugs get them from their friends and relatives to start with. The highest percentages of people using Lortab for non-medical purposes fall in the age group of 18-25 years, according to the survey completed in 2005-2006. Thus Lortab is an addictive drug the addicts of which need special attention for their proper treatment."
494,"LSD Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",lsd-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/11,"LSD, or as it is called in full name lysergic acid diethylamide, is yet another dangerous drug which is mostly abused by younger people. It is usually sold in capsules, pills or even in liquid form. In liquid form, LSD is soaked into a specially prepared blotting paper which is often printed with various cartoon characters and such, and perforated. Every tiny square in it is relatively a 1 dose of LSD. LSD is also colloquially called “acid” on the street.    LSD is semisynthetic psychedelic drug that is very well known for having great psychological effects on its user, and it can include altering thinking processes, synesthesia, closed and open eye visuals, and a very altered sense of illusion and time. LSD certainly had one of its key roles in 1960s subculture, and it was very well known and used as a recreational drug amongst many people.    This drug is considered non-addictive, and it isn't known to cause any brain damage, and it also has a very low toxicity that's relative to dosage. Although, LSD users can certainly get various negative reactions after usage, such as paranoia, delusion, and anxiety problems.    It was first synthesized back in 1938 by Albert Hofmann from chemical called ergotamine, which is a grain fungus usually found growing on rye. LSD is highly sensitive to ultraviolet light, chlorine and oxygen, even though it can last for long period of time if it's being stored away from the moisture at light on a relatively low temperature. In its purest form, LSD is a very odorless, tasteless, and colorless substance. Hofmann has subsequently discovered its psychedelic properties back in 1943, and it was firstly commercially introduced in 1947 by Sandoz Laboratories as a drug that has various psychiatric uses, and since then it quickly became a therapeutic agent that appeared to show pretty great promise. Later, in the1950s, the Central Intelligence Agency began to think that this drug could be applicable for chemical warfare and mind control, and agency called MKULTRA has started to propagate the drug amongst young students and servicemen.    LSD later become quite popular for its recreational usage by youth culture during 1960s, and it was one of the main recreational drugs of the hippie movement in 1960s. This of course has resulted to political firestorm which has resulted in prohibition of LSD.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>  Signs and symptoms of LSD usage widely differ from user to user, and they are mostly experiential, that is, changes in feeling and sensations for the user are far more dramatic than any observations one could make of physical indications.    The most common signs that the user may experience are certainly hallucinations, rapid heart rate, higher blood pressure and tremors. It can also greatly reduce someone's perception of reality which could lead to paranoia and delusion, and it can also permanently change someone's mental perception of the surroundings. Constant LSD usage can also lead to flashbacks of hallucinations, even years after experiencing them.    User's sensory perception can also be easily altered to certain degrees. LSD usage can lead to depersonalization, acute depression and acute anxiety. Long-term effects of LSD usage can usually be severe depression and schizophrenia.  <h2>Effects of Abusing LSD</h2>  LSD fully alters someone's mental perception, and by altering how serotonin transmits in someone's brain, it greatly affects the user's brain function. It can cause various effects, such as hallucination and everything related to it. Users of LSD can see various non-existing images, feel sensation that can seem real, but actually don't exist, and hear strange sounds that don't exist.    LSD users can experience perceptual shifts and impulsiveness of mood, reporting the experience of numerous emotions at the same time. The biggest problem with LSD usage is in its unpredictability, since it can vary so widely from user to user.    Long-term effects can also include mood disturbances, disorganized thinking and various flashbacks.  <h2>Statistics of LSD</h2>  In Europe, 4.2% of people aged between 15-24 have at least once taken LSD. A study which was released in 2008 has find out that there are approximately 3.15 million people in USA from ages 12 - 25 that have taken LSD at least once. In a 1975 survey of more than 17,000 US high school students on drug-usage and attitude, 7.2% of students reported having used LSD at least once in their lives."
496,"Luminal Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",luminal-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/11,"Its generic name is phenobarbital while Luminal is the brand name that is known by many. Phenobarbital is a barbiturate that has been in existence for long and is widely used all over the world. It contains sedative and hypnotic properties. It has been recommended by the World Health Organization for use in developing countries as a first-line for partial or general tonic-conic seizure. In developed countries, though it is no longer being used as a first or second line choice for most of the seizure types, it still treats neonatal seizures. It has the injected form used to control status epilepticus and oral form used for prophylactic.  <h2>Signs and symptoms when one use Luminal</h2>  Doctors advise that one should not take this drug just because he or she feels like taking it. Besides, you need not to take it simply because a friend is using it yet it was not prescribed to you. There are signs and symptoms that will indicate that you need to take the drug. These are what the doctor actually looks out for before prescribing the drug to you. It is prescribed when one experiences too much anxiety, tension and fear. It is also used for certain types of seizures. It is mostly for short term treatment. This is because taking it more often makes it less effective over time so a patient may have the urge to take more hence get addicted to it. This is the reason why prolonged use of the drug is discouraged.  <h2>Long and Short Term Effects of Abusing Luminal</h2>  <h3>Short term effects</h3>  Barbiturates such as Luminal increase the activities of gamma amino butyric acid which is the main neurotransmitter in the brain. However, when you take too much Luminal after a short time it will shut off large part of the brain and give sedative relaxing effects. In fact, they produce a similar effect to that of alcohol intoxication. So for instance it will result in slurred speech, dizziness, confusion, unusual excitement, decreased motor control and impaired judgment. This can even lead to death, an outcome even more likely when combining this drug with alcohol.  <h3>Long term side effects</h3>  There are recreational users who simply find it fun to take this drug over and over. They claim that it offers the feeling of contentment, euphoria and relaxation. This makes it quite easy to get addicted to this drug and you end up taking more doses always. One actually develops physical and psychological dependency on the drug by using it repeatedly. The more you use the drug the more you are exposed to fatal overdose and the more you expose your life to danger.  <h2>Statistics of Luminal drug</h2>  The drug is available in 15mg, 16.2mg, 30 mg, 60mg, 90mg, and 100mg tablets. It also has 16mg capsules. If you prefer liquid form you can find it 15mg/5mL and 20mg/5mL. Lastly, it is contained in injection form at 30mg per mL, 60mg per ml, 65mg/ml, and 130mg/ml.    According to Pharmacokinetic data, Luminal’s bioavailability is greater than 95%. Its protein binding capability is 20-45%. Besides, its metabolism is mostly CYP2C and has a half life of 53 to 118 hours. It can be excreted through renal and fecal process.    The right dosage is as follows for different classes:    Anticonvulsant  Adult: PO 100-300mg/d  IV/IM: 200-600mg or maximum 20mg per kg  Child: PO/IV 3-8mg per kg or 125mg per m2/d  Neonate: PO/IV 3-4mg/kg (max: 5mg per kg/d)    Status Epilepticus  Adult child: IV 15-18 mg per kg in one or divided doses  Neonate: IV 15-20 mg per kg in one or divided doses    Sedative  Adult: PO 30-120 mg/d  IV/IM 100-200 mg/d  Child: PO 6mg per kg per d or 180mg per m2 in 3 divided doses  IV/IM: 16-100 mg/d (1-3 mg/kg)    General advice to patients is to take the drug only when prescribed by the doctor. Besides, you should take exactly as prescribed. Do not drive or operate machinery when taking this drug because you might not know the effects it will end up having on you. If you are expecting or planning to have a baby always inform your doctor before getting any medicine or let the doctor know of any other medicine that you are taking too. Abuse of Luminal will lead one to rely on it fully for psychological and physical satisfaction. On the other hand abrupt withdrawal from taking it having used it for long will lead to serious withdrawal symptoms like convulsions and can even lead to death. Therefore you should withdraw gradually."
498,"Meperidine Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",meperidine-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/11,"For those who might perhaps be not in the know, Meperidine, which goes under the brand name Demerol, happens to be a narcotic analygesic somewhat similar to morphine. This drug is, for the most part, utilized in the short-term treatment of moderate to acute pain. It is consequently widely in use in the hospital setting before or after major surgeries and also to offer relief to pregnant women in labor or during delivery.    Meperidine can also be used in the effective management of the types of physical pains that are usually associated with some forms of cancer, heart attack incidents, or even serious accidents. This medication carries out its function as a tranquilizer by acting on the central nervous system to change the body’s perception of pain.    Naturally like most other opioid narcotics, Demerol is known to produce a trance-like euphoric mental state, which, unfortunately, has made it very prone to be abused by individuals whom it might be legally prescribed to and even people who don’t use it for medical purposes. Due to this sobering fact, Meperidine has been unequivocally categorized as a schedule II controlled substance. This essentially means that it is supposed to be only prescribed or administered under the direct supervision of a certified healthcare provider, such as a physician. To this end Demerol is very rarely prescribed on an outpatient basis.    This drug is available in various forms such as pills, oral liquids or even IV liquids. The latter type have been known to possess the most potent effect on the body, and are therefore the most abused of these 3 varieties of Meperidine.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Meperidine Abuse</h2>  Prolonged usage this medication can create a dependency on the user’s body and he/she will be likely to experience withdrawal symptoms when administration is delayed or suddenly stopped. This can include restlessness, running noses, sleep disturbances, muscle and abdominal pains, nausea, vertigo and even vomiting. To heighten the effect of this drug some abusers raise the dosages they take or take it simultaneously with other medication, which most often than not leads to overdose and dangerous drug interactions. Some of the most conspicuous signs of Meperidine overdose include lapses in consciousness, bluish lips, fingernails and even palms.  <h3>Short Term Effects of Meperidine Abuse</h3>  As mentioned, this medication is very popular with many opioid narcotics abusers because of its “high” producing effect on the brain. However, like most of these drugs, non-medical Meperidine usage can be very detrimental to your health. Some of the most common short term mental effects of abusing this medication include drastic mood swings, anxiety, hallucinations, impulsiveness and agitation. Physically, abusers of this drug can experience migraines, dryness of the mouth, constipation, vertigo or even vomiting.  <h3>Long Term Effects of Meperidine Abuse</h3>  Prolonged abuse of Demerol can of course lead to very serious health complications such as liver cirrhosis, seizures, heart attack, stroke, coma, and in the worst circumstances, death. This should definitely be an eye opener for those individuals that might perhaps think they can abuse this drug without any extreme consequences to their wellbeing.  <h2>Meperidine Abuse statistics</h2>  The abuse of opioid narcotics, Meperidine included, has witnessed an unprecedented upsurge despite the various checks put into place in the relevant dispensers to curb this trend. If the Harvard health publications are to be believed, a survey conducted from 2004 – 2008 revealed that opioid narcotics emergency room related visits rose by a whooping 111% over those four years.    A recent WHO study carried out within the US suggests that Demerol abuse impacts virtually everybody either directly or indirectly. A Meperidine abuser can be your relative, friend, or even neighbor, and his/her actions can obviously affect your life. Traffic departments records in the US reveal that up to 10% to 22% of road accidents usually occur as a direct result of oipiod narcotic abuse, Demerol being one of them.    When it comes to mundane financial matters, approximately $484 million is spent each year globally in relation to the abuse of this medication. This obviously includes the healthcare and treatment and rehabilitation of patients. Unemployment related expenses and even criminal costs of the improper dispensing and ultimate abuse of Meperidine. It is thus high time that the relevant authorities and society at large appreciate the immense harm that the abuse of this drug can lead to and take the necessary remedying measures."
500,"Mescaline Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",mescaline-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/11,"Mescaline is a naturally occurring psychedelic alkaloid. It’s primarily associated with its hallucinogenic effects, comparable to that of psilocybin (magic mushrooms) and LSD. Mescaline is found naturally in the peyote cactus, the Peruvian torch, and the San Pedro cactus. It’s also found in trace amounts in certain types of beans.    Peyote, or mescaline, has historically been used by Native Americans in Mexico for almost 6,000 years. In religious and traditional use of peyote, the cactus is cut at ground level. This causes the cactus to grow new heads, which are harvested and dried to make small disk-shaped “buttons.” These are then either chewed raw or diluted in water to produce the desired hallucinogenic effects.    Mescaline was first isolated in a laboratory setting in 1897 by Arthur Heffter, and was originally synthesized by Ernst Späth in 1919. In 1955, Christopher Mayhew took part in an experiment for the BBC where he consumed 400 milligrams of mescaline under the watchful eye of psychiatrist Humphry Osmond. The recording never made it on air due to the controversial nature of the content.    Mescaline has long been considered valuable as a medicine. Studies show it can treat alcoholism, depression, and other diseases. Due to the Convention of Psychotropic Substance’s classification of mescaline as a Schedule I controlled substance its availability is severely limited to potential researchers. Naturally, very little in the way of substantial research has been done on the drug’s medical applications since the early 1970s.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>  Mescaline use, like many other psychedelics and hallucinogenic drugs produced a very strong and noticeable effect in the user. Due to this fact, most people who use peyote recreationally will only do so in the company of those who can tolerate drug usage. Using Mescaline causes serious changes in perception and behavior, and oftentimes it becomes hard to differentiate between hallucinations and reality. Although there is no surefire way to know if someone is using mescaline on a casual basis, one can look for the following symptoms to determine if someone might be abusing mescaline regularly:  <ul>  	<li>Anxiety</li>  	<li>Depression</li>  	<li>Diminished Memory</li>  	<li>Psychological Problems</li>  	<li>Restlessness</li>  	<li>Psychosis</li>  </ul>  <h2>Effects of Abusing Drug</h2>  As mentioned, the effects of mescaline are both strong and last a while. To determine if someone is currently tripping on mescaline, try to notice symptoms like vomiting, shaking extremities, powerful hallucinations, panic attacks, terror attacks, dizziness, increased blood pressure, loss of appetite, embellished emotions, increased heart rate, lack of depth perception, mood swings, delusions of safety, and confusion.    It is often very difficult for someone under the effects of mescaline to have the cognitive ability to recognize that they are indeed tripping. Frequently, users will be unable to tell what reality is and isn’t, and because of this it’s very difficult to hide the fact that one is under the effects of mescaline.  <h2>Statistics of Drug</h2>  Due to the nature of the drug, it’s very hard for scientists and researchers to determine the extent of mescaline use. After 1998, it had all but disappeared from government drug use statistic reports, usually being grouped with “other hallucinogens” instead of having its own category. As far as hallucinogens go, peyote use has been in steady decline while ecstasy and psilocybin use have been increasing.    DEA reports corroborate the decline in mescaline use. From 1980 to 1987, only nineteen pounds of peyote were confiscated from drug dealers. Compare that to the more than 15 million pounds of marijuana confiscated. There was not a single case of peyote trafficking in this time period.    There is no gender data associated with mescaline, partially due to a lack of reports. It’s estimated that there is neither gender abuses the drug more than the other. From the early to mid 1990s, hallucinogen use among high school students increased due to more frequent rave activity, but after 1998 it began to drop down again. Modern use of mescaline is equally rare, with most of the usage being associated with college aged individuals.  <h2>Conclusion</h2>  Mescaline is a drug that while being well known for its effects, is under-studied and its use is mysterious at best. Due to the lack of data on the drug, the only conclusions that can be made are that it’s a drug that is more often “experimented” with than abused like traditional narcotics. Additionally, it has deep rooted ties to religions as well, which ensures that use will not completely die out. If the drug were reclassified by the Substance Abuse Control Act, it would be studied more frequently and possibly be used for medicinal purposes."
503,"Methadone Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",methadone-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/11,"Methadone is one type of opioid that can be used to treat people with morphine or heroin addiction problems. This drug is useful to counter the side effects of both drugs. It is also used to reduce pain associated with health problems. Along with naloxone and buprenorphine, this drug is effective in treating addiction to other drugs. However, some people abuse this drug as well. This drug can cause some health problems when it is consumed more than its recommended dosage.

Over time, abuse of Methadone can also cause muscle pain.  <h2>Statistics</h2>  According to United States government statistics, more than 5,000 people die from methadone addiction. Among the most dangerous side effects are the ones caused by mixing Methadone with other drugs, such as benzodiazepines, which due to suppression of respiratory system, can be fatal.    Methadone treatment is very costly for most people. The treatment for this addiction is more expensive than other treatments for other drugs, so it’s best to catch this drug addiction early. It should be treated by professionals immediately, so it doesn't cause any other problems in the future."
155,"Secobarbital Abuse - Signs, Symptoms and Effects",secobarbital-abuse-signs-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/11,"Secobarbital is a type of drug that belongs to a group known as barbiturate, sold under the brand name Seconal. A barbiturate is a depressant that affects the central nervous system. The drug was patented in the United States of America in the year 1934. The original manufacture of the drug was a pharmaceutical company by the name Ohm. The drug was made specifically for medical use as it was used in cases of people suffering from epilepsy and sleep disorders. It was also used as an anesthetic in simple surgical procedures as it reduces response to pain. The prescribed drug is only used for medication on a patient over a small period of time to avoid addiction. The drug has developed various slang terms over the years which include “red dillies” or “seccies.”    Continuous use of the drug over a span of about two weeks can easily lead to addiction, and because the body creates resistance to the drug over time, more will be needed to achieve a desired effect. With the increase of resistance to the drug, there will be an increase in dosage used, creating a physical dependence to the drug. The difference between a prescribed dosage and a lethal dosage of Secobarbital is so minimal that once one becomes an addict the effects of the drug can be severe. This makes it even more serious for patients who are medically advised to use the drug to use it per the doctor’s directives  <h2>Symptoms and Effects of Secobarbital Abuse</h2>  The effects of Secobarbital are vivid enough to the outside world once one becomes an addict. The signs of S<strong>ecobarbital abuse</strong> are almost similar to those of a person intoxicated with alcohol. They include slurred speech, dizziness and impaired judgment. Once one takes doses of Secobarbital the effect is normally felt about twenty to thirty minutes later. It’s critical that once these signs are identified the addict seeks medical attention as soon as possible to avoid the long term effects of the drug abuse. Continuous abuse of Secobarbital over a long period of time can lead to severe body impairment and in a more serious case fatality. Some of the long term effects include respiratory failure, disintegration of the nervous system and going into a comma.    After constant abuse of Secobarbital, it becomes crucial that one seeks professional counsel and help to deal with the withdrawal from the drug. Because the body becomes tolerant to the drug, more usage of the drug becomes prevalent. This makes the withdrawal effects much severe in comparison to a mild abuser of the drug. Withdrawal effects include insomnia, eye problems, nervous breakdown and seizures. This withdrawal effects need to be supervised by a trained medical physician to avoid further implications due to lack of the drug. Withdrawal symptoms usually begin to happen about twelve hours after the last dose, minor symptoms are seen first before more severe symptoms emerge. This process of detoxing may last to a minimum of about fifteen days.    This prescription drug started getting misused in the 1960’s as it was seen as a recreational drug. At this era, many deaths occurred due overdose of Secobarbital. The implications of this led to the prescription drug used less in the medical field in the eighties. Statistics indicate that the young (age 17-21) are the ones easily being influenced to abuse prescription drugs which include Secobarbital. The abuse of the drug was on a rise in recent years and was among the favored prescribed drug for drug abusers due to the intoxicating effect it created. Statistics also indicate that Secobarbital abusers usually end up using harder drugs to counter the resistance the body creates to the drug. Prescribed medication, including Secobarbital were found to be the main cause of the higher percentage of death in drug abuse cases, these deaths are more than deaths caused by illegal hard drugs like cocaine and heroin.  <h2>Summary</h2>  It is realized that secobarbital is a very important drug in the medical field which has had great impact over the years it’s been available. Immense negative effects have been attributed to misuse of the drug for recreation and thus people should avoid indulging in abuse of the drug. Those already misusing the drugs should seek professional help to help them overcome the addiction."
505,"Methadrine Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",methadrine-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/11,"Methadrine, which is a trade name for methamphetamine hydrochloride, is a stimulant medication that was used for clinical purposes. However, it now has very few medical uses and leads to many adverse psychological and physical effects when abused.    Methadrine, in its crystal form, has become very popular in the United States and other parts of the world. This drug was almost three times more popularly used compared to crack cocaine in 1999.    Crystal meth has been in existence for about 100 years. In 1893, crystal meth was for the first time created from ephedrine, and by 1919 we had the drug in its familiar crystal form. Methamphetamine first started being manufactured in Hawaii, United States, in 1960s. Methadrine stimulates the central nervous system. Not only can it have serious side effects, even in the short term, if it is used for a long time, the user can become psychologically and physically dependent on the substance.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>  The signs and symptoms of methadrine addiction will differ from person to person, depending on duration of addiction, genetic makeup, frequency of use and amount used. Though a single sign cannot signify addiction, several of the following signs noticed over a short period of time might suggest addiction:  <ul>  	<li>Skin picking – those addicted to meth, are known to pick their skin obsessively. The marks left behind due to this picking can look like extreme case of acne, leaving behind open sores on one’s face.</li>  	<li>Tooth decay – tooth decay or tooth loss is also one of the noticeable signs.</li>  	<li>Skin crawling – addicts also complain about experiencing a crawling skin, and this disorder is known as formication.</li>  	<li>Hair loss – owing to the dangerous chemicals an addict ingests, and because of lack of nutrients, frequent hair breakage can also occur.</li>  </ul>  <h3>Meth abuse mood symptoms include:</h3>  <ul>  	<li>Mood swings</li>  	<li>Depression</li>  	<li>Euphoria</li>  	<li>Intense anxiety</li>  </ul>  <h3>Behavioral symptoms</h3>  <ul>  	<li>Hiding drug abuse or lying</li>  	<li>Increased libido</li>  	<li>Withdrawing from pleasurable activities</li>  	<li>Increased talkativeness</li>  	<li>Improper hygiene</li>  	<li>Increased participation in physical activities</li>  	<li>Increased alertness</li>  </ul>  <h3>Physical symptoms</h3>  <ul>  	<li>Hypersomnia</li>  	<li>Insomnia</li>  	<li>Decreased appetite</li>  	<li>Dilated pupils</li>  	<li>Cardiac arrhythmias</li>  	<li>Severe hypertension</li>  	<li>Hyperthermia</li>  </ul>  <h3>Psychological symptoms</h3>  <ul>  	<li>Irritability</li>  	<li>Restlessness</li>  	<li>Confusion</li>  	<li>Aggression</li>  	<li>Delusions</li>  	<li>Hallucinations</li>  </ul>  <h2>Long-Term and Short-Term Effects of Abusing Methadrine</h2>  When one takes methadrine, it creates a false sense of energy and well-being, and as a result, a person will try to push his body faster and further than is normal. The drug users may experience a severe mental or physical breakdown or a crash, once the effects of the drug wear off.    Using the drug continually can decrease normal feelings of hunger, and it can consequently lead to extreme weight loss. It can also result in nausea, hyperactivity, disturbed sleep patterns, irritability and aggressiveness. Dependence on the drug in fact has both long and short-term effects.  <h3>Short-term effects:</h3>  <ul>  	<li>dilation of pupils</li>  	<li>loss of appetite</li>  	<li>increased blood pressure, body temperature and heart rate</li>  	<li>unusual sleep patterns</li>  	<li>nausea</li>  	<li>erratic, violent and bizarre behavior</li>  	<li>irritability, hyperexcitability, hallucinations</li>  	<li>seizures, convulsions, and high doses can even lead to death</li>  </ul>  <h3>Long-term effects:</h3>  <ul>  	<li>lung, kidney and liver damage</li>  	<li>permanent damage to blood vessels of brain and heart</li>  	<li>high blood pressure resulting in strokes, death and heart attack</li>  	<li>if smoked, results to respiratory problems</li>  	<li>if sniffed, can lead to destruction of nose tissues</li>  	<li>weight loss due to malnutrition</li>  	<li>apathy, disorientation, confused exhaustion</li>  	<li>severe tooth decay</li>  	<li>depression</li>  	<li>psychosis</li>  	<li>damage to brain just like results from Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy and stroke</li>  	<li>sweaty skin</li>  	<li>weakness</li>  	<li>nightmares</li>  	<li>increased body temperatures</li>  </ul>  <h2>Methadrine Statistics</h2>  The worldwide production of amphetamine-type stimulants (including methamphetamine), as estimated by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, is nearly 500 metric tons per year and has about 24.7 million abusers.    In 2007, 4.1 % of American tenth grade students and 4.5% of high-school goers are reported to have used methamphetamine at least one time in their lives.    In 2008, as reported by the United States government, about 13 million people above the age of 12 have used the drug at least once, and amongst them 529,000 are regular users.    In 1996, in the United States, the percentage of those who were admitted to be treated for their dependence on amphetamine and methamphetamine was 3%, and in 2006 this increased to 9%. States like Hawaii have a very high percentage, where, in 2007, amongst people who needed help for alcohol or drug abuse, 48.2 % were methamphetamine users."
509,"Methamphetamine Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",methamphetamine-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/11,"Methamphetamine also known as meth, ice, crystal, chalk, among other street terms is a very addictive stimulant drug, chemically related to amphetamine. It normally takes the form of a white, odorless, bitter tasting crystalline powder. Once you're on it, it becomes difficult to quit its use, as has been demonstrated by its 92% relapse rate (according to the Crystalmethfaq.com). The withdrawal symptoms of the drugs include insomnia, exhaustion, extreme depression, restlessness and insatiable appetite. Some people may experience psychotic reactions after withdrawal. However, people do kick meth addiction for good each and every day. It will take a process which requires commitment and the desire to live clean.    Methamphetamine was first synthesized from ephedrine in the year 1893 by a Japanese chemist named ""Nagai Nagayoshi."" Three decades later, in the year 1919, methamphetamine hydrochloride was synthesized by pharmacologist ""Akira Ogata"" through reduction of the ephedrine using iodine and red phosphorus. During the World War Two, methamphetamine was extensively used by all branches of German armed forces because of the stimulant effects, and also by the pilots of various other countries involved in the war. Obetrol was one of the first brands of pharmaceutical methamphetamine products. Due to its psychological and stimulant effects, Obetrol became a highly popular diet pill in the US in the 1950s and ‘60s. Gradually, as the effects of this drug became known, many governments started to regulate its production and its distribution. For example, in the early 1970s in the US, methamphetamine became a schedule-II controlled substance according to Controlled Substances Act.  <h2>Signs And Symptoms of Methamphetamine Abuse</h2>  There are several physical signs to show someone's using meth or ""tweaking."" Grinding of teeth and the subsequent decay are two major signs of meth use. The facial skin usually breaks out in attacks of acne forming itchy and blotchy open sores. A user can aggravate the sores by repeatedly picking at them. A meth user may go for many days without eating or sleeping, and may experience a dramatic weight loss. Some other physical signs include heavy sweating and involuntary body movements.  <h3>Mental Signs</h3>  Some users may become aggressive and irrational after taking the drug. Some can have visual and auditory hallucinations with bouts of paranoia and delusional thinking. Their sleep patterns may change with heightened symptoms of insomnia. A meth user usually talks too fast with slurring words, often not making any sense. Withdrawal from chronic meth abuse may cause nightmares, irritability, panic attacks, and confusion. Sometimes a meth addict can lapse into a near-psychotic mental state and may suffer severe anergia or lack of energy during withdrawal.    The sudden increase in serotonin and dopamine levels will produce a rush of physical pleasure. The rush may occur at different intensity levels and at different times depending on just how the meth was consumed; if it was taken by smoking, the effects will occur almost immediately, in about 10-seconds. Ingesting or snorting the meth will produce the same effect, but weaker, in about 3 to 5 minutes. An overdose can at times occur immediately after taking meth. The symptoms can include high fever, heart problems, and convulsions. For a pregnant mother using meth, the child may be born equally addicted to the drug.  <h3>Short Term Effects</h3>  The immediate psycho-active effects of meth on one's brain and the central nervous system are normally caused by the increased levels of neurotransmitters. The neurons release extra-dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin into one's bloodstream resulting in a feeling of increased energy, concentration, and alertness. A high dose puts a user in a state of euphoria which usually turns into agitation and anxiety. As the ""high"" wears off after about 6 to 12-hours, mental fatigue, exhaustion, and depression sets in, and at times with increased suicidal thoughts.  <h3>Long Term Effects</h3>  Chronic abuse of meth will produce an elevated and irregular heart-rate along with increased/high blood pressure. Long-term meth use usually contributes to a number of cardiovascular problems/issues including inflammation of the lining of the heart's muscle and increased risk of a heart attack. A hardcore user can be jittery, restless, hyperactive, and may experience shaky hands and tremors. The drug can cause lung damage if smoked or deterioration of the nasal lining if snorted excessively.    As of the year 2004, approximately 11.7 million Americans of ages 12 and older reported using methamphetamine at least once (National Survey on Drug Use and Health). As a Schedule-II stimulant, meth has a very high-potential for abuse."
511,"Methaqualone Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",methaqualone-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/11,"Methaqualone, also known as Mandrax or Quaalude is a synthetic drug that depresses the central nervous system, Methaqualone will generally induce sleep for a person who uses it. Though the drug helps in treating patients suffering from hyperactivity or insomnia it is barely prescribed by health specialists.    The drug was created in India back in 1951 by Syed Hussain Zaheer and Kishore Kacker. Later on, in around 1965, the drug was launched as an option for barbiturates, and it quickly became the most prescribed, “non-addictive” drug in Britain. Its sales also became eminent among pharmacies in both Japan and across Europe. It was believed by scientists that the drug was not addictive and since it was effective, the Food and Drug Administration approved it that same year.    Many years passed prior to the recognition of the Methaqualone’s side effects. Patients began to cling to the use of the drugs as time went by. Years after, the addiction of the drug was a concern all over. In 1984, the government realized that the drug was becoming addictive, and it was grouped under Schedule I as a controlled substance. In 1988, it was listed under the UN convention on Psychotropic Substances, and since then, dealing the drug has been illegal. Everything from the manufacturing, distribution, sale, or misuse of the drug is banned and punishable by law.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>  Because of its growing addictive qualities, stopping the drug, especially abruptly could result in:  <ul>  	<li>Restlessness: The patient will generally be weaker and less active. This is why the drug was primarily used to help people with insomnia.</li>  	<li>Irritability: The patient will scratch uncontrollably due to the use of the drug.</li>  	<li>Confusion: Just like most of the drugs, this one will cause perplexity in the user.</li>  	<li>Hallucination: The “out-of-the-world” feeling makes the users have hallucinations.</li>  	<li>High fever</li>  	<li>Seizure: There might be an occurrence of seizures on the user.</li>  	<li>Muscle Twisting</li>  	<li>Insomnia: The excess use of the drug can lead to lack of sleep.</li>  	<li>Mild Tremors</li>  </ul>  <h2>Effects of Quaalude</h2>  The drug causes some effects, some might last for a long time, while others will only be seen in a short while. The short term effects include:  <ul>  	<li>Euphoria: The patient will have an uncontrolled joy, which won’t last for long</li>  	<li>Increased Libido: The user will have an unusual sexual desire</li>  	<li>Headache: There might be some cases of migraines in the patient as well</li>  	<li>Depression: Besides being jubilant, the user can feel depressed, this will also last for a short while</li>  	<li>Rashes</li>  	<li>Abdominal cramps, though it can be experienced in all the genders, the ladies will experience it more</li>  	<li>Lower pulse</li>  </ul>  <h3>Long-term Effects</h3>  <ul>  	<li>The effects that are most likely to be long lasting to the user include:</li>  	<li>Dependency: The user will develop a constant addiction to the drug and it will be difficult to get them off.</li>  	<li>Frenzy: The user will always visualize imaginary stuff, which might take a while before it heals.</li>  	<li>Nausea/Vomiting.</li>  	<li>Coma: Some might end up having a coma.</li>  	<li>Cardiac arrest.</li>  	<li>Total renal failure.</li>  	<li>Paresthesias: This is the numbness of the toes and the fingers.</li>  </ul>  <h2>Statistics of Methaqualone</h2>  A study done in South Africa showed that the abuse of Methaqualone led to a higher crime rate in the country, especially in terms of homicide. 19.4% of those arrested and tested for drugs were found to be using Mandrax.    Several campaigns and organizations have been initialized in order to cut down the addiction of the drug, which has negatively affected the productivity of individuals. The work and self-progress of a user decreases majorly as they get deep into the drug. Methaqualone is a lethal drug that can end up causing seizures or even coma, so it is one dangerous drug in the human system."
513,"Methylphenidate Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",methylphenidate-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/11,"<h2>Methylphenidate as a Prescription Drug</h2>  There are many medications that have psychoactive properties and for this reason they may be abused and cause dependence. For example, minor tranquilizers that are prescribed for sleeping problems, panic disorder, or anxiety can be addictive. Even if they were prescribed by a doctor, a person can become dependent on these drugs, develop drug tolerance, and need to take more and more of the drug in order to have the same effects. Prescription medication is the third common cause of addiction in the United States, after marihuana and alcohol.    Among the most commonly abused prescription drugs that can cause addiction are included:  <ul>  	<li>Tranquilizers and sedatives</li>  	<li>Pain relievers</li>  	<li>Stimulants</li>  </ul>  Methylphenidate is one of the prescription drugs with the potential of being abused and causing dependence. Methylphenidate is known by various trade names such as Equasym XL, Methylin, Ritalin or Concerta. It is a psycho-stimulant drug commonly prescribed for treating attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, as well as narcolepsy and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. Methylphenidate was developed 50 years ago by Novartis Pharmaceutical Company. Since then many clinical studies have researched the drug efficiency. It has a good safety record for the treatment of the attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Methylphenidate has been first licensed by FDA in the year 1955 for treating hyperactivity. Ritalin became heavily prescribed in the ‘90s. However, like all the psycho-stimulant drugs, it can be abused and cause addiction.    Stimulants such as Ritalin increase energy, attention, and alertness because they open up the pathways of the respiratory system, constrict blood vessels, increase blood pressure and heart rate, enhance the effects of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain, and give a feeling of euphoria.    When psycho-stimulant drugs such as methylphenidate are abused they pose health risks such as:  <ul>  	<li>They may become addictive</li>  	<li>Can cause seizures and irregular heartbeat</li>  	<li>Can create extremely high body temperature</li>  </ul>  Many people tend to think that prescription drugs are safer but when abused they can be addictive and increase the risks of adverse effects. Abusing prescription drugs can take more forms. Sometimes, unaware of the risks of sharing medications, abusing prescription drugs can take the form of taking medication that was prescribed for a different person. Teenagers are often abusing prescription drugs such as Ritalin that were given by a relative or a friend.    Another way to abuse prescription medication is taking a drug in a different manner or in higher quantities than prescribed. Sometimes abusers crush the tablets and inject or snort the content. That amplifies the effects of the drug due to the faster absorption in the bloodstream.    Methylphenidate is also abused often by students who seek to improve their performance in school. The drug may boost alertness; however there is no evidence that it can improve cognitive functioning for those people who do not suffer of ADHD.    Methylphenidate has a high risk of creating addiction because it achieves its effects by influencing the same neurotransmitter systems as the illicit drug cocaine.    Symptoms of prescription drug abuse:  <ul>  	<li>Taking higher doses than prescribed</li>  	<li>Forging or stealing prescriptions</li>  	<li>Seeking prescriptions from more than one doctor</li>  	<li>Poor decision-making</li>  	<li>Excessive mood swings</li>  	<li>Increase or decrease in sleep</li>  	<li>Appearing to be high</li>  </ul>  <h2>Prevention of methylphenidate addiction</h2>  Because it is well known that methylphenidate can be habit-forming it is recommended that you never take the medication for a longer time, or more often, than prescribed, and never take a larger dose. In case that you take too much methylphenidate, the medication may no longer help you control your symptoms, and you may think that you need to take large amounts of the medication. Also take care to not take the drug with alcohol or while using other street drugs.    If you used methylphenidate for long time it is not recommended to stop taking the medication without consulting your doctor, especially in case of overuse. The dose should be decreased gradually and under doctor supervision because suddenly stop of taking methylphenidate after overuse may cause severe depression.  <h2>Recovery from prescription drug addiction</h2>  Addiction to any drug whether is prescribed or illicit can be considered as a disease and can be treated like other chronic diseases. Millions of people are dealing with long-term recovery from drug addiction every year. For those addicted to prescription drugs there are a variety of treatments, but treatment generally incorporates several components, including counseling, detoxification, and even the use of pharmacological therapies."
515,"Morphine Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",morphine-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/11,"Morphine is a very commonly used opiate drug in medical practice. It is primarily used to help patients get relief from short and long term pain. Similar to other opiates, Morphine is also derived from the poppy plant. It is categorized as a narcotic as well, due to the high potential of people getting addicted to it.    Morphine is available in various different forms such as injection, in a syrup, suppository, and tablet. It can be inoculated, swallowed, or even smoked, based on what form of it is being used by the user.    Slang terms like 'Miss Emma’, 'Monkey,’ and 'M’ clearly show the level of abuse and popularity of this drug. People, who are addicted to substances like Cocaine and Heroin often make their way to Morphine when they are not able to get their hands on the desired addiction.    Since Morphine belongs to the family of opiates drugs, it has a potency for addiction. Morphine users often get addicted to this drug, leading to serious health risks. A regular Morphine user can get addicted to it in a short while, soon after the beginning of the doses. Morphine addiction is a greater concern for almost every country in the world.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>  Individuals struggling with Morphine addiction can display particular signs and symptoms of the drug abuse. From physiological to social, a person has to suffer from a number of complications as a result of long term use of the drug. If you are already dealing with Morphine addiction, or if you know someone who is, it is important to be informed about the signs and symptoms, so it can be corrected in time.  <h3>Psychological Symptoms:</h3>  <ul>  	<li>Lack of attention to surroundings</li>  	<li>Euphoria</li>  	<li>Impaired mental performance</li>  	<li>Psychosis</li>  	<li>Hallucinations</li>  	<li>Increased mental illness</li>  	<li>Delusions</li>  	<li>Decreased memory</li>  	<li>Preoccupation with the Morphine</li>  	<li>Continued use of Morphine despite of knowing its causes and effects</li>  	<li>Poor judgment</li>  </ul>  <h3>Behavioral symptoms:</h3>  <ul>  	<li>Sleepiness</li>  	<li>Poor work performance</li>  	<li>Doctor shopping to get more drugs on multiple prescription</li>  	<li>Healthcare fraud</li>  	<li>Social isolation</li>  	<li>Forging prescriptions</li>  	<li>Financial problems</li>  	<li>Lying to acquire more substance</li>  	<li>Fixation on codeine</li>  	<li>Frequent ER visits</li>  	<li>Stealing from friends and family to get refills</li>  	<li>Hiding when using the substance</li>  	<li>Concealing the stash in different places</li>  </ul>  <h3>Physical symptoms:</h3>  <ul>  	<li>Impaired physical performance</li>  	<li>Fainting</li>  	<li>Dry mouth</li>  	<li>Dizziness</li>  	<li>Constipation</li>  	<li>Rashes</li>  	<li>Low blood pressure</li>  	<li>Urinary retention</li>  	<li>Decreased sex drive</li>  	<li>Tolerance</li>  	<li>Decreased hunger</li>  	<li>Interference with the menstrual cycle</li>  	<li>Disorientation</li>  </ul>  <h2>Effects of Abusing the Drug (Both Short and Long Term)</h2>  Morphine addiction can compromise a person’s lifestyle choices in several ways. He has to go through a number of physical, emotional, psychological, and social effects. The short term effects are the result of the body getting intoxicated and lead to physical disturbances. But the long term effects are dangerous and in severe cases, they can also lead to death. The following are a few ways in which an individual can be affected by the abuse of Morphine:  <ul>  	<li>Nausea</li>  	<li>Dizziness</li>  	<li>Loss of appetite</li>  	<li>Job loss</li>  	<li>Headache</li>  	<li>Dehydration</li>  	<li>Constipation</li>  	<li>Difficulty swallowing</li>  	<li>Dry mouth</li>  	<li>Reduced sex drive</li>  	<li>Inhibited cough reflex leading to choking</li>  	<li>Low blood pressure</li>  	<li>Incarceration</li>  	<li>Respiratory depression</li>  	<li>Bradycardia</li>  	<li>Respiratory distress</li>  	<li>Major depression</li>  	<li>Liver damage</li>  	<li>Legal issues</li>  	<li>Heightened pain sensitivity</li>  	<li>Domestic problems</li>  	<li>Sleep apnea</li>  	<li>Circulation problems</li>  </ul>  <h2>Statistics of Drug</h2>  According to the statistics of 2008 by NSDH (National Survey on Drug Use and Health), it was reported that about 12 million Americans between the age of 12 and 30 have had abused a number of prescription pain relievers, which also included Morphine.

517,"MS Contin Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",ms-contin-overview-signs-and-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/11,"When morphine was extracted from opium in the early 19th century, it was marketed as a painkiller and used for treating alcohol addiction. Nobody would have thought that one day morphine and its derivatives like morphine sulfate contin (usually abbreviated as MS Contin) will be abused so much. According to a drug abuse survey conducted by the US government, more people are abusing analgesic drugs like MS Contin, which are generally prescribed for chronic pain relief, than the drugs that fall under the category of sedatives or tranquilizers. The reason for this is simple - painkillers are available much more easily and do not cost as much.  <h2>Morphine VS. MS Contin</h2>  MS Contin is same as morphine but due to a little difference in the compound structure, MS Contin tablets are released slowly into the bloodstream as opposed to plain morphine. The result of the extended release mechanism is that the effect of morphine in the patient lasts longer - often 10 to 12 hours. This is what makes MS Contin so popular among the drugs abusers. What they do not realize is that MS Contin is even more addictive than the plain morphine.  <h2>MS Contin Abuse</h2>  MS Contin is a painkiller prescribed to patients with extreme pain. When it is prescribed by the certified doctors, they often tell the patients not to take large dosages at one time but spread small amounts of dose over time. But people use it as a recreational drug and the abusers often take a large dose in one shot - which causes large amounts of morphine to release into the bloodstream. This can lead to morphine overdose symptoms like very slow breathing rate and may even lead to death.  <h2>MS Contin Addiction</h2>  Like all the opiate drugs (drugs extracted from opium), MS Contin is also addictive as well as habit forming. Because it is essentially morphine when released into the bloodstream, it has the same addiction potential as the morphine. What makes it even more dangerous than plain morphine is that unlike morphine it keeps releasing itself into the bloodstream for a long time (10-12 hours). As someone takes more pills, their addiction keeps increasing day by day. After some time, it changes the brain so much that the addicted person cannot survive without this drug and the chances of the recovery become minimal.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Abuse</h2>  If someone is taking too much of MS Contin, then there are some telltale signs that can give them away. Like all the opiate drugs, MS Contin makes a person sleepy, reduces the respiratory as well as brain functions. Here is a short list of symptoms in a person with MS Contin abuse:  <ul>  	<li>Slow or shallow breathing (can reduce to 5-6 times in a minute)</li>  	<li>Feeling confused all the time and thoughts are not clear</li>  	<li>Constipation as well as vomiting</li>  	<li>Feeling faint, dizzy and about to collapse</li>  	<li>Loss of muscle tension</li>  </ul>  <h2>Short and Long Term Effects of MS Contin Abuse</h2>  The short term effects of the MS Contin include relief in pain, feeling of nausea, euphoria, reduced respiratory functions, sudden drop in blood pressure levels, dizziness, vomiting and the lowering of the heart beat rate. In addition, it reduces the ability to work or think properly. Among the long term effects of this drug, the first effect is dependence which later changes into addiction, many physical changes appear in the brain, constipation, cardiac arrest, kidney failure, loss in muscle mass, confusion, depression, etc.  <h2>Recovery from Addiction</h2>  The opiate drugs (including MS Contin) actually change the brain chemistry so much that the person who is addicted to this drug takes on a completely new personality. The addiction may drive that person to do many things that they would not have otherwise done.    The best chance an addicted person has for recovery is under the constant supervision of experts in a drug rehabilitation center. Depending on how long a person has been abusing the drug, it takes a shorter or longer time to recover. Typically, the first 30 days are the most difficult, after which it may take many months of regular supervision to get rid of this addiction. On average the success rate of the recovery is 70%, an encouraging figure that suggests the individual’s commitment to recovery plays a large role. The sooner addicted persons commit themselves to a rehabilitation program, the better are their chances of recovery."
520,"MSIR Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",msir-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/12,"MSIR refers to the Instant Release form of Morphine Sulphate. Any medicine that belongs to the opiate family is also called narcotic due to its high potential for addiction. MSIR is basically a Morphine that is used to treat moderate to chronic pain. It is often prescribed to be taken during pain, but a lot of people get used to it, which becomes an addiction in the long run.    MSIR is very commonly prescribed to help patients get relief from both short and long term pain such as back pain, but can be taken for momentary pain such as breakthrough pain, and for chronic pain such as fibromyalgia. Similar to other opioids, MSIR also has a tendency to develop addiction, tolerance, and dependence in patients.    MSIR is available in various different forms such as syrup, injection, suppository and tablet. It can be swallowed or inoculated based on the form of drug is being used. Slang terms for Morphine include White Stuff’, Miss Emma’, Monkey’, Duramorph’, Roxanol’, or M’. People, who are addicted to harmful substances like Cocaine and Heroin, use drugs with Morphine concentration when they are not able to obtain the desired drug because morphine is actually considered milder than many other opiates.    MSIR is also used by many people for recreational purposes, and long-term use can lead to serious health risks as well as addiction. Just like any opiate, when MSIR is used for an extended period of time, it can have adverse physiological and psychological changes in a person, leading to more painful and complicated life. Given the dangers of MSIR abuse, many countries have already started putting strict measure on the sale and supply of the drug.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>  People who are addicted to MSIR, often display signs and symptoms, varying from a person to person. A number of the psychological, social and behavioral symptoms might seem normal at first, like behavior due to hectic lifestyle patterns, but as you look further these symptoms grow in degree and tolerance development.  <h3>Psychological Symptoms:</h3>  <ul>  	<li>Lack of attention</li>  	<li>Euphoria</li>  	<li>Hallucinations</li>  	<li>Impaired mental performance</li>  	<li>Psychosis</li>  	<li>Increased mental illness</li>  	<li>Preoccupation</li>  	<li>Delusions</li>  	<li>Decreased memory</li>  	<li>Continued use despite of knowing the effects</li>  	<li>Poor judgment</li>  </ul>  <h3>Behavioral symptoms:</h3>  <ul>  	<li>Doctor shopping to get more drugs on multiple prescription</li>  	<li>Healthcare fraud</li>  	<li>Social isolation</li>  	<li>Sleepiness</li>  	<li>Lying to acquire more substance</li>  	<li>Stealing from friends and family to get refills</li>  	<li>Hiding when using the substance</li>  	<li>Fixation on codeine</li>  	<li>Frequent ER visits</li>  	<li>Poor work performance</li>  	<li>Forging prescriptions</li>  	<li>Financial problems</li>  	<li>Concealing the stash in different places</li>  </ul>  <h3>Physical symptoms:</h3>  <ul>  	<li>Impaired physical performance</li>  	<li>Constipation</li>  	<li>Decreased hunger</li>  	<li>Interference with the menstrual cycle in females</li>  	<li>Decreased sperm count in men</li>  	<li>Rashes</li>  	<li>Low blood pressure</li>  	<li>Urinary retention</li>  	<li>Fainting</li>  	<li>Dry mouth</li>  	<li>Dizziness</li>  	<li>Decreased sex drive</li>  	<li>Tolerance</li>  	<li>Disorientation</li>  </ul>  <h2>Effects of Abusing Drug (Short and Long Term)</h2>  MSIR addiction can often lead to wrong lifestyle choices.

522,"Nembutal Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",nembutal-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/12,"Nembutal is a non-selective nervous system depressant that is normally used as a sedative for hypnotic purposes as well as an anticonvulsant in sub-hypnotic dosages. On the street, this drug is commonly referred to as “nembies.”    This drug is actually a barbiturate that should only be used for a short period of time as recommended by the physician. It can induce sleep in people who experience sleep management problems or act as a pre-anesthetic, especially in emergency situations to control acute convulsive effects in patients who experience seizures. Also, it can be used to induce sleep during surgery. Distribution and usage of this drug is controlled by the Federal Controlled Substance Act under DEA schedule II.  <h2>How is Nembutal introduced into the body?</h2>  It is usually administered through an injection into a vein or muscle by a doctor or a nurse. Do not try to self-inject this drug unless you have information and skill on how to do so correctly to avoid unnecessary complications.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>  Just like any other barbiturate drug, Nembutal is habit forming. That is, one can develop heavy dependence after a continued use. Most of the signs of dependence are either psychological or physical depending on one’s biological condition. In fact, some of these signs are similar to those of a patient suffering from chronic alcoholism.  <h3>Short Term Effects of Abusing Nembutal:</h3>  Some of the common short term effects experienced by most people who confessed to have used Nembutal include loss of balance, nightmares, nausea, headaches, irritability, loss of coordination, loss of memory and concentration, constipation and drowsiness after a dose.  <h3>Long Term Effects of Abusing Nembutal:</h3>  They include hallucinations, weak or shallow breathing, slow heart rate and a weak pulse. Nembutal is also capable of rendering birth control pills ineffective and can harm an unborn baby if used during pregnancy.  <h3>Signs of Allergic Reactions:</h3>  Biological interaction can lead to allergic reactions. Common signs of allergy include difficulty in breathing and swelling on the face, tongue, lips, and throat. To avert such effects, you should never use Nembutal if you suffer from or have a history of liver disease, kidney disease, severe asthma, mental illness and chronic pain. Based on these facts, it is very important that you furnish the doctor with accurate details about your health to help in making intelligent decisions.    It is highly recommendable to consult a professional health care service provider if you experience any of these effects to get immediate medical attention. As mentioned earlier, this drug is habit forming and so it should only be used by the person prescribed to use it. This means that you should never share it with anyone.  <h3>Withdrawal symptoms:</h3>  Closely associated with cessation of Nembutal, indications include:  <ul>  	<li>anxiety</li>  	<li>muscle Twitching</li>  	<li>vomiting</li>  	<li>nausea</li>  	<li>dizziness</li>  	<li>progressive weakness</li>  	<li>convulsions</li>  	<li>delirium</li>  	<li>orthostatic hypertension</li>  </ul>  Some of these symptoms are life threatening and so it is important to detox from the drug in a controlled environment such as a rehabilitation facility. Here, you will be monitored by professionals 24/7. They have the skills, experience, and information on how to counter any of these symptoms before they can adversely affect your overall health and wellbeing. Just to be sure that the medication is not harming your internal organs, the physician may decide to carry out blood tests. The functionality of your liver and kidney may also be tested, and so it is very important that you do not miss any follow-up visits.  <h2>Treatment of Nembutal Addiction</h2>  The first step is a comprehensive evaluation of your health to determine the addiction level. Using this information, the doctor will be in a position to choose a treatment method that suits you best. During counseling sessions, you will get professional advice on how get sleep using other safe methods such as meditation, changes in caffeine intake, yoga, physical exercises and the list continues. The amount of time required to recover fully depends on your level of addiction.  <h2>Statistics</h2>  Nembutal addiction is a growing problem especially among the young generation. In 2007, it is estimated that over 6 million people from all across the globe used Nembutal for non-medical purposes.  <h2>Closing Advice</h2>  It is very important that you cooperate with the personnel at the rehab facility to speed up the recovery process. Do not shy away from requesting for personalized support if you experience any absurd withdrawal symptoms."
524,"Norco Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",norco-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/12,"Several drugs are prescribed by doctors for the sake of relieving pain. Among the most common drugs that are prescribed by doctors is Norco. This is a medicine that health specialists prescribe to the patients for the sake of relieving excess pain.    Norco is a medication that has a combination of 2 forms in one tablet, hydrocodone and acetaminophen. Hydrocodone is a synthetic narcotic and acetaminophen is a nonnarcotic medicine. It is not exactly understood how the drug works in relieving pain in the body. The acetaminophen helps in reducing the pain in a different way from hydrocodone.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>  Symptoms related to the misuse of Norco include the swelling of areas such as the tongue, face, tongue, throat and lips. There also might be breathing difficulties. Therefore, in case you notice any of the following signs, check with your doctor immediately:  <ul>  	<li>Reduced breathing and slow heartbeat</li>  	<li>Fainting or feeling dizzy</li>  	<li>Fear, confusion or uncommon behavior or thoughts</li>  	<li>Convulsions or seizure</li>  	<li>Problem with urinating</li>  	<li>Upper stomach pain, nausea, itching, poor appetite, dark stools and urine, or yellowing of the eyes and skin</li>  </ul>  Some of the other symptoms that might be noted, though not that serious, might include vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, ringing in the ears, blurred vision, mood swings, stomach upset, among others.  <h2>Effects of Misusing the Drug</h2>  Other effects will be short term and they will or might disappear after some time.  <h3>Short-term Effects</h3>  In the short term, Norco can provide relief for the pain associated with broken bones, arthritis, cramping, and injuries. It may even make the pain of a certain injury seem to disappear. Nevertheless, this pain will only vanish for some time and is prone to reappear after a while. Because Norco inhibits the body’s natural warning signs, its use may contribute making the injury worse.  <h3>Long-term Effects</h3>  In addition to the obvious potential for addiction, the drug can also cause urine retention, hearing loss, respiratory despair, coma or stupor. For that reason, it is highly recommended that you contact your doctor if you note any of the side effects mentioned.  <h2>Statistics of Norco</h2>  The misuse and abuse of Norco in America have cost the citizens more than $484 million every year. This figure includes the loss in wages, resulting from non attendance to work. It also entails losses due to traffic accidents, crime, health care costs and related criminal justice expenses.    The NHTSA – National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has reported that about 10 – 22% of accidents on roads are related to drivers under influence of Norco. The obsession of the drug is related to a minimum of 50% of all the crimes committed in America. The people that had been arrested for criminal violence like homicide or assault were under the influence of Norco.    If you are under the influence of this drug, or if a friend of yours is, then you might want to know the signs and symptoms related to it. The ability to relieve pain makes people enjoy the feeling, not knowing how dangerous it gets. The reduction in pain doesn’t necessarily mean that one is healed, rather, it is just a matter of relieving the pain caused by a given condition. It is important with Norco to remember that it can be lethal drug if taken in excess for a long time."
526,"Opium Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",opium-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/12,"Opium has long been known to possess the ability to kill pain. Before being banned as an addictive drug, opium was actually recommended by doctors. Opium is the dried oil obtained from opium poppy seed pod. Opium contains about 12 % morphine. Morphine is an alkaloid frequently processed to produce heroin. Opium is highly addictive. Traditionally the un-ripened pod is slit open and the sap seeps out and dries on the outer surface of the pod. The resulting yellow-brown latex is very bitter in taste and contains varying amounts of alkaloids such as codeine, morphine, papaverine and thebaine.  <h2>History of Opium</h2>  The history of this drug goes back to ancient times when opium was used for ritual purposes and for anesthesia. The ancient Indians, Romans, and Egyptians used opium as a pain reliever and often included this drug in surgical procedures to keep pain at bay. Opium has been mentioned in medical texts from the ancient world that dates back to the times and writings of Galen, Dioscorides and Avicenna.    Opium still continued to be used for medical purposes up through the American Civil War, after which other medications were developed. Today, many drugs such as opioids and morphine are derived from poppy plant, the same plant used to make opium.    Historically, this drug was used for recreational purposes during the 15th century but because this was a rare and expensive drug, its use was very limited. During the 17th century, the drug became popular in China. During this time, the drug was mixed with tobacco and smoked throughout China and this was the first time opium addiction was noticed. Later during the 20th century, many countries prohibited use of opium.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>  An individual struggling with opium addiction will display most or all of the following symptoms.  The mood symptoms include depression, mood swings, anxiety, irritability and euphoric mood for a few hours.  Behavioral symptoms include forging prescriptions for opiates, decreased performance at job or school, stealing narcotics from family, not fulfilling his/her duties, restlessness, social isolation, lethargy, lies and withdrawing from once-pleasurable activities.    The physical symptoms of opium addiction are pain relief, exhaustion, sedation, respiratory depression, vomiting, sedation, insomnia, itching, constipation, muscle spasms, coma, nausea, seizures, sweating and sometimes even death.    Psychological symptoms include paranoia, addiction, delusions, memory problems, mental disorders, delusions, hallucinations and decrease in emotional well-being.  <h2>Effects of Abusing Opium</h2>  Most people who abuse opium fail to think about this drug’s long term effects. Opium abuse can lead to tolerance which results in physical dependence on this drug. This can prove to be very difficult to treat and also difficult to overcome.    Long term effects of this drug include many health related problems and may even impact the social well-being, spiritual well-being, and emotional well-being of the addict. With time, use of opium is likely to lead to opium addiction which requires professional help to overcome.    Users who regularly smoke opium are at an increased risk of suffering from lung disease, lung cancer and many other health problems. Smoking the drug causes irreparable damage to the liver, heart, lungs and kidneys. The damaging effects of smoking this drug often linger with the user for years and sometimes affect the user for the rest of his/her life even after the drug is no longer being used. Lack of oxygen to the brain and other vital organs of the body can lead to long term damage.    Renal failure is one of the many potential long term effects of opium use. Injecting opium or opium derivatives such as morphine, heroine or other prescription painkillers can also have many long term effects. The veins may get damaged when this drug is injected regularly. Prolonged use of opium can lead to tolerance, dependence and opium withdrawal. Withdrawal symptoms include vomiting, anxiety, diarrhea, nausea and high blood pressure.  <h2>Statistics of the Drug</h2>  Opiate abuse is one of the most common forms of drug abuse in the U.S. Over 210 million opiate prescriptions were given out in the year 2010. About 12 million people were admitted for abusing opiates in 2010.    The highest rate of opiate use is found in those aged 29 years or younger. This rate decreases with age. Overall, men are twice as likely as women to become addicted to opiates."
528,"Oramorph Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",oramorph-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/12,"Sharifa Sanderson Oramorph is a prescription medication that is used to treat severe pain. It is available as an oral solution in two different concentrations. This medication directly interferes with chemicals in the brain and central nervous system that cause people to detect pain. It contains morphine sulfate as an active ingredient. Individuals who use this prescription medication may develop tolerance or dependence over time.  <h2>History of Oramorph Use in the U.S.</h2>  Oramorph is one of the forms of morphine which is used in the United States. It and other drugs like it which contain morphine are classified as opioid analgesics. Doctors typically prescribe Oramorph after a patient has had surgery or a severe injury and needs something that can give them round the clock pain relief. It is also given to some cancer patients. People sometimes become tolerant of the drug after taking it for long periods and it no longer has any effect on them. If you notice that the drug is not helping with your pain any more you should speak to your doctor about it.    Oramorph is a controlled substance and for this reason, you have to check that its use is allowed in any country that you plan to visit. Schedule 2 substances may also be allowed into another country in specific amounts because they can cause death when they are abused. Quite a few people in the US who become addicted to the drug were using it as prescribed. However, as a Schedule 2 drug, Oramorph can become addictive really quickly. Some people who become dependent on the narcotic seek out alternate means of getting the drug after their prescription runs out.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Oramorph Abuse</h2>  People who are taking Oramorph can become addicted in just a few weeks, even when they are following a doctor's instructions. Pill bottles and other signs of morphine abuse such as syringes may be present when a person is abusing Oramorph. You may even see round white Oramorph pills in their home long after they have been scheduled to stop using the medication. If you detect several of these symptoms in someone you love, it is possible that they have become addicted to the drug:  <ul>  	<li>They no longer need Oramorph but still use it</li>  	<li>They feel that it is impossible to live comfortably without using the drug</li>  	<li>The take larger dosages without a doctor instructing them to do so</li>  	<li>They feel like they would do almost anything to get their hands on a little more of the drug</li>  </ul>  They may also display the following signs if they attempt to quit on their own:  <ul>  	<li>Backache</li>  	<li>Irritability</li>  	<li>Dilated pupils</li>  </ul>  <h3>Short and Long Term Effects of Oramorph Abuse</h3>  There are several short and long term effects that result from abusing Oramorph. People who use the drug may experience the following short term effects:  <ul>  	<li>Drowsiness</li>  	<li>Constipation</li>  	<li>Stomach pain</li>  	<li>Nausea</li>  	<li>Dizziness</li>  	<li>Headache</li>  	<li>Vomiting</li>  	<li>Loss of concentration</li>  	<li>Mild itching</li>  	<li>Anxiety</li>  	<li>Tightness in the throat</li>  	<li>Problems swallowing</li>  	<li>Hives</li>  	<li>Swelling</li>  </ul>  Long term misuse of Oramorph can lead to addiction or even an accidental lethal overdose. People who overdose even slightly on this drug may immediately notice shortness or shallowness of breath. If this happens to you, seek medical help immediately. People who abuse Oramorph put themselves at risk of going into a coma at any time. In addition to that, people who become addicted usually go through painful withdrawal symptoms. If you suspect that you have become dependent on Oramorph, seek assistance from a treatment center so you can improve your health.  <h2>Statistics Related to Oramorph Abuse in America</h2>  Statistics released by the CDC indicate that the number of deaths from opiates has quadrupled in just ten years. By using this information, you can determine whether your own use of Oramorph indicates that you have become dependent on the drug. About 50% of patients who take the drug have gastric problems and quite a large number of persons who use this drug and other opiates die from overdoses each year. More than 17,000 people have died from opioid overdoses since 1999.    Treatment centers can help people who are addicted to Oramorph wean themselves from the drug gradually, so that they experience fewer unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Their aim is to keep patients comfortable and safe while the toxins are being removed from their body. This means that someone is always nearby to support a patient while they are going through effects such as sweating and vomiting."
530,"Orlaam Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",orlaam-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/12,"Orlaam, also called Leyomethadyl, belongs to a group of drugs called narcotic analgesics. The drug is mostly used for addiction treatment programs where it substitutes for illegal narcotics. Examples of programs where it is used include support group meetings, counseling, and any other type of treatment that has been recommended by a doctor. Orlaam aids in preventing symptoms that may take place as a result of using narcotics.    Detoxification programs taper or continually reduce the amount of Orlaam used until the addict becomes drug free. However, when used for maintenance programs, this drug is used to prevent people from using street drugs for long periods of time. With the use of Orlaam, the addict stands at a better chance of decreasing his or her craving for other types of narcotics.    Use of Orlaam is just some portion of treatment that a patient can apply in treatment. Doctors and clinic personnel are supposed to draw a treatment plan for the patient. The treatment plan may include activities such as attending support group meetings, frequent visits to the clinic of the doctor and making a lot of changes in lifestyle that help individuals to stay away from illegalized drugs.    Orlaam adds to the effects experienced from alcohol and other medicines that cause drowsiness or slow down the rate at which the nervous system operates. Medical experts have recommended users of Orlaam not to drink beverages with alcoholic content and depressants such as pain medicine, sleeping medicine, and dental anesthetics. These are only supposed to be taken by a well trained and experienced doctor who has prior information that you are under treatment of Orlaam.  <h2>Effects of Abusing Orlaam</h2>  The drug makes some people become drowsy. This is common, especially when increase in the dose of the drug occurs. It is advisable for users of this drug to know how they should react to it before they do anything that may be dangerous, such as driving.    For example, users may feel drowsy and not alert in the first days of using the drug but with time they get used to it. However, it is necessary that you inform your doctor if drowsiness becomes so severe that it interferes with daily activities. Effects such as fainting, lightheadedness and dizziness are also expected, especially when the user gets up suddenly from a sitting or lying position. That is why it is important to get up slowly since it will lessen the problem.    Informing the doctor that you are under treatment that involves taking Orlaam is necessary for patients who are in need of surgery or emergency treatment. Side effects are likely to increase if patients let doctors give drugs without information about Orlaam treatment. Prolonged use of Orlaam can cause severe constipation.    There are several foods that are not supposed to be eaten when taking the drug. Presence of different medical problems in the body may make the drug bring other side effects, and that’s why the doctor should be told of any medical problem. Examples of such problems include asthma, colitis, kidney disease, heart disease, liver disease and many others. Before using Orlaam it is important to weigh the risks involved in taking the drug and the benefits that the drug will derive to the body."
532,"Oxycodone Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",oxycodone-overview-signs-symptoms-effects,2014/08/12,"Oxycodone is a semi-synthetic opioid drug used to treat moderate to moderately severe pain in patients. It was first developed in 1916 in Germany and started to be used clinically as an opioid analgesic from 1917. The drug is derived from thebaine, which comes from the oriental poppy plant.    Oxycodone is available in different forms as a prescription drug. There are oral formulations taken as a tablet, or the drug can be delivered as an intravenous or intramuscular injection. Oxycodone also comes in short-acting (Oxecta) and long-acting forms (Oxycontin), where one form acts immediately and the other form produces effects over time.  <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Oxycodone Use</h2>  Oxycodone can cause a number of different side effects, some of which are more common than others. Even though people use the drug to treat their pain, the drug can affect other areas of the body and produce some undesirable signs and symptoms.    Some common side effects caused by oxycodone that you may experience when taking the drug include constipation, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, dry mouth, increased sweating, anxiety and itching. Other side effects include abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nervousness, diarrhea, urine retention and shortness of breath.    Apart from these side effects, allergic reactions may occur in people who are allergic to oxycodone. Signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction to taking the drug include a rash, swelling and breathing difficulties. Immediate medical attention is required in these cases.  <h2>Short and Long Term Effects of Abusing Oxycodone</h2>  While oxycodone is a prescription drug that is used to treat pain in a clinical setting, it is a commonly abused drug. In fact, many cases of oxycodone abuse start in patients taking the drug clinically to treat their pain, but because it can cause tolerance and addiction, it may lead to drug misuse. That is why whenever an opiate is prescribed for analgesic use, careful monitoring of the doses taken and its effects on the patient is required to prevent this from happening.  <h3>Short-term effects</h3>  Oxycodone abuse has both short-term and long-term effects. In the short-term, oxycodone can cause you to become euphoric - in other words, go on a ""high."" The drug makes you feel happy and reduces your anxiety. This aspect of oxycodone may make it attractive as a drug to be abused, but euphoria is generally a short-lived effect of the drug which is soon overtaken by the more negative effects of oxycodone abuse.    Another short-term effect of abusing the drug is drowsiness. As the drug has a slowing-down effect on your respiratory and central nervous systems, it might make you feel drowsy and sleepier than usual.  <h3>Long-term effects</h3>  Oxycodone is a drug that should only be used for short amounts of time, rather than as a long-term drug. So in people who abuse oxycodone over a long period of time, it can cause serious long-term effects that can really put their health in danger. One of the long-term effects of oxycodone abuse is increased tolerance to the drug. This develops when you use the drug for a long time, and you need higher doses of the drug for it to have the same effects.    Abusing the drug over a long period can also cause respiratory distress, which is related to the drug's depressing effects on your respiratory system. You may have trouble breathing, and due to a lack of oxygen, you may also experience lightheadedness or dizziness.    Another long-term effect of oxycodone abuse is physical dependence, which develops when you become so reliant on the drug that you need to take it in order to function. If the drug is stopped abruptly, you may develop withdrawal symptoms.  <h3>Overdose</h3>  In people who abuse oxycodone, there are also the effects of overdose that are a concern. High doses of oxycodone can cause shallow breathing, decreased heart rate, hypotension, apnea, cold skin, circulatory collapse, respiratory arrest and death.  <h2>Statistics of Oxycodone Abuse</h2>  Oyxcodone is the most commonly abused opioid drug in the United States. It is misused by about 11 million Americans, according to statistics from the US Department of Health and Human Services. Oxycodone abuse is responsible for about 100,000 hospital admissions each year, and was linked to 14,800 deaths in 2008."
534,"OxyContin Overview, Signs and Symptoms and Effects",oxycontin-overview-signs-and-symptoms-and-effects,2014/08/12,"OxyContin is a medication that, if taken correctly, can provide relief from pain, whether from cancer or an injury. It is administered intra-nasally, by injection, or in pill form, according to the Treatment Solutions website. It is derived from oxycodone, the opioid first produced in Germany in 1916. Little did its developers know that it was to become one of the most abused drugs of all time.  <h2>History of OxyContin</h2>  Oxycontin arrived in the US in 1939. However, it wasn't until 1996, when Purdue Pharma began manufacturing it, that it began to be widely prescribed. By 2001, it was the best selling narcotic on the market. Plus people with leftover prescription pills began selling it on the black market at very high prices.    Seeing that it sold so well, the drug manufacturer wanted to increase its sales. The best way to do that, the firm thought, was through more aggressive advertising. Advertisers began encouraging people to use the drug more than the recommended two times daily, and downplayed this sometimes deadly drug's potential for addiction.    In 2007 OxyContin's harmful effects came to light when several lawsuits were filed against Purdue Pharma for these reckless, aggressive techniques. The pharmaceutical was forced to pay fines when it was found liable for the amount of addictions and deaths that it caused. As of 2013, the Acadiana website reports that the composition was changed to make it more difficult to crush the drug because in its crushed form, it is more likely to cause death.  <h2>Symptoms of Abusing OxyContin</h2>  The symptoms of OxyContin addiction are quite troubling. But if you know what they are, you can be aware of certain changes in behavior that a person displays after they've become an addict. For instance, the individual may become depressed, or he/she may seem at times euphoric. The person may seem anxious, and even difficult to live with at times, due to irritability.    Once confronted with your suspicions, the person may lie about the amount of pills he/she is taking, or attempt to hide them from you, according to the Acadiana website. The addict may also engage in other dishonest practices, such as doctor-shopping, or hunting for doctors who will prescribe the narcotic. He/she may also forge their doctor's signature on prescriptions, or routinely ""lose"" them in order to obtain more prescriptions for the drug. Interpersonal relationships become increasingly less important than the high the addict receives from the drug.  <h3>Short Term/Long Term Effects</h3>  As the Intheknowzone website points out, OxyContin produces several short term symptoms, such as dizziness, severe itching, nausea, vomiting, constipation, low blood pressure, and slowed heart rate and breathing. According to the Intheknowzone website, drowsiness and confusion lasting up to six hours after taking the drug can also happen. In the long term, abuse of this medication can produce addiction; restlessness; muscle problems--such as spasms and pain; chills and goose bumps, and anxiety that has increased in severity. Also more frightening are the symptoms of cardiovascular damage, such as heart infections, collapsed or scarred veins, and clogged blood vessels. Any one of these symptoms can lead to death through a heart attack. Death can also occur as the individual suddenly stops breathing. Addiction to this drug can also indirectly cause HIV as being under the influence can impair judgment about sharing needles or having unprotected sex.    These symptoms not only affect an individual, but if the subject happens to be pregnant, can affect a child as well. The baby can be born addicted to this potent narcotic, and also be more prone to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).  <h2>OxyContin Statistics</h2>  The Acadiana website estimates that nine percent of all adults have abused or will misuse oxycodone (OxyContin). Thirteen million have used the drug recreationally, according to the United States Department of Justice. It is now considered to be the second most used illegal drug; only marijuana is used more frequently. Sadly, there is a 500 percent increase in people seeking treatment for addiction, as of 2011. Also there is a 129 percent increase in visits to emergency rooms due to complications stemming from the abuse of this drug.  <h2>Conclusion of the Matter</h2>  Treatment for this addiction is painful.

Also, breaking down for no reason can occur. However, escaping this addiction is essential. But it must be done under the supervision of medical professionals because the withdrawal symptoms are so severe.
